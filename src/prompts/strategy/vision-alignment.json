The company priorities are: {company_priorities}. The current roadmap includes: {current_roadmap}. For each roadmap item, assess its degree of alignment to both the vision and the company priorities, and categorize it as strongly aligned, partially aligned, or misaligned. Identify gaps where the vision or company priorities are not adequately represented on the roadmap, and recommend specific additions or reprioritizations. Provide a narrative that the team lead can use to communicate the roadmap's strategic rationale to leadership, including how trade-offs were made and what was intentionally deferred.",
