  "prompt_text": "Draft a set of {num_objectives} OKRs for {team_or_initiative} covering the {time_period} period. These OKRs must ladder up to the following strategic context: {strategic_context}. Each objective should be ambitious yet achievable, and each key result should follow the {measurement_preference} measurement approach with clear thresholds for what constitutes on-track, at-risk, and off-track progress. For each OKR, explain the rationale for why it was chosen over alternatives, identify the leading indicators the team should monitor weekly, and note any cross-team dependencies that could block achievement. Ensure the full set of OKRs tells a coherent story about what the team will accomplish and why it matters.",
