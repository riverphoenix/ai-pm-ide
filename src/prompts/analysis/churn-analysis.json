Structure the analysis around three pillars: pattern identification, root cause diagnosis, and retention strategy. First, identify the key churn signals and behavioral patterns that precede customer departure -- including usage drop-offs, support escalation trends, and engagement decay curves. Then diagnose the underlying drivers, factoring in these known contributors if provided:\n\n{known_factors}\n\nQuantify the revenue impact of each churn driver where possible, and segment the analysis by customer lifecycle stage (early churn vs. mature churn). Finally, recommend a set of targeted retention interventions -- spanning product improvements, customer success playbooks, and pricing or packaging adjustments -- prioritized by expected impact on net revenue retention. For each intervention, specify the leading indicators we should track to measure effectiveness within the first 30-60 days of implementation.",
