For each product, break down the specific capabilities offered, the maturity and depth of implementation, and any notable gaps or limitations. Where possible, note differentiating approaches -- for example, whether a product takes a platform-native vs. integration-based approach. Provide a comparison matrix summarizing the findings, followed by a narrative analysis that calls out the most significant takeaways and their implications for our product strategy.",
