Identify the top recurring themes, categorize them by severity and frequency, and distinguish between symptoms customers describe and the underlying root causes. For each theme, assess the business impact -- considering factors like revenue at risk, expansion potential, and competitive vulnerability. Where applicable, incorporate these known themes as a starting lens for the analysis:\n\n{key_themes}\n\nPrioritize the findings into a tiered action plan: quick wins that can be addressed within a sprint cycle, medium-term investments requiring roadmap commitment, and strategic bets that would require cross-functional alignment. For each recommendation, articulate the customer outcome we are solving for, not just the feature request.",
