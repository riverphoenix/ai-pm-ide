Begin by evaluating our current positioning:\n\n{current_positioning}\n\nThen assess how this positioning holds up against the competitive landscape:\n\n{competitive_landscape}\n\nIdentify gaps between how we position ourselves and how the market actually perceives us. Evaluate whether our current positioning is defensible, differentiated, and aligned with where the market is heading over the next 2-3 years. Surface specific repositioning opportunities -- whether through messaging shifts, capability investments, or segment focus -- that could strengthen our competitive moat. Provide a clear recommendation on the highest-leverage positioning move we should consider, along with the risks and trade-offs involved.",
