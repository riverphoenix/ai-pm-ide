The primary metric under evaluation is {primary_metric}, with a sample size classified as {sample_size} and a test duration of {test_duration}. Assess statistical significance, evaluate practical significance beyond p-values, and identify any novelty effects or Simpson's paradox risks across segments. Provide a clear ship/no-ship recommendation with supporting rationale, outline any follow-up experiments that could deepen understanding, and flag any methodological concerns that could affect the validity of the results.",
