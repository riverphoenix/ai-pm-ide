The release notes should be written for a {audience} audience, adjusting the level of technical detail accordingly. Open with a brief summary of what this release delivers and why it matters to users.\n\nInclude the following changes:\n{changes_summary}\n\nOrganize the notes into logical sections such as New Features, Improvements, Bug Fixes, and Breaking Changes (if applicable). Each entry should describe the change, the user-facing impact, and any action required by the user. For technical audiences, include relevant API changes or migration notes. For non-technical audiences, focus on outcomes and benefits rather than implementation details. End with any known issues or limitations.",
