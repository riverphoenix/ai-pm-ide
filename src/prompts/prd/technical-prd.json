  "category": "prd",
  "prompt_text": "Write a Technical Product Requirements Document for \"{feature_name}\" that bridges product intent and engineering execution. The current system context is as follows: \"{system_context}\". Given this baseline, define the target architecture, key technical decisions (with rationale and alternatives considered), API contracts with request/response schemas, data model changes, and migration strategy. The target timeline is {target_timeline}, so scope the implementation plan accordingly with clear milestones and dependencies. Technical constraints to factor into every decision: \"{technical_constraints}\". Include sections for Architecture Overview with a component diagram description, API Specifications, Data Model Changes, Infrastructure Requirements, Performance Benchmarks, Rollback Strategy, and a detailed Implementation Plan broken into workstreams with effort estimates.",
