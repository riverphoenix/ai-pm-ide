The core Jobs-to-be-Done statement driving this feature is: \"{jtbd_statement}\". Structure the PRD around this JTBD by first decomposing it into functional, emotional, and social dimensions, then deriving requirements that address each dimension. The primary priority area for this feature is {priority_area}, so weight your non-functional requirements and acceptance criteria accordingly. Include sections for Problem Context, User Stories mapped to the JTBD, Detailed Requirements (must-have vs. nice-to-have), Success Metrics tied directly to the job outcome, and a phased Release Plan that delivers value incrementally while validating the JTBD hypothesis at each stage.",
