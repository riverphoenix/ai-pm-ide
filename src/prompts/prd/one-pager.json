The core problem we are solving: \"{problem_statement}\". The target audience for this initiative is \"{target_audience}\" -- ground every claim and recommendation in their specific needs and pain points. The primary business impact we expect to drive is {business_impact}, so frame the value proposition and ROI narrative around that axis. Key success metrics to include: \"{success_metrics}\". Structure the brief with these sections, each no longer than a short paragraph: Problem Statement, Proposed Solution, Target Audience, Value Proposition, Key Success Metrics, High-Level Timeline, Risks and Mitigations, and a clear Ask or Next Steps. Write it in a tone suitable for executive and cross-functional review -- persuasive, evidence-oriented, and free of jargon.",
