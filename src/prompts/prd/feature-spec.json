Here is what currently happens today: \"{current_behavior}\". The desired outcome we need to achieve is: \"{desired_outcome}\". Working from the gap between current behavior and desired outcome, define the complete feature scope including: a step-by-step User Flow for the primary path, Alternative Flows for secondary scenarios, Edge Cases and how the system should handle each one, detailed Acceptance Criteria written in Given/When/Then format, UI/UX Considerations describing key interaction patterns, Error States with user-facing messaging, and Dependencies or prerequisites. Be explicit about what is in scope and out of scope, and flag any open questions that need product or design input before development begins.",
