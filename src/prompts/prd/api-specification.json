  "prompt_text": "Write a complete API Specification for the \"{api_name}\" API using the {api_style} style. The core resource this API manages is described as follows: \"{resource_description}\". The authentication method is {auth_method}, so include the relevant auth flow details, required headers or parameters, and token lifecycle considerations in the specification. Structure the document with these sections: API Overview and purpose, Authentication and Authorization details, Resource Model with field definitions and types, Endpoint Definitions (for each: method, path, description, request schema with required/optional fields, response schema for success and error cases, and example payloads), a standardized Error Handling strategy with error codes and messages, Rate Limiting and pagination approach, Versioning Strategy, and a Getting Started guide with a sample integration workflow. Write this so that both internal engineers and external developers can use it as the single source of truth for building against this API.",
