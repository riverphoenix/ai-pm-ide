  "prompt_text": "You are a senior product manager responsible for breaking down a high-level epic into a set of implementable user stories that a development team can deliver incrementally. Analyze the epic \"{epic_name}\" and decompose it into vertical slices that each deliver demonstrable user value. Size the stories so they can realistically be completed within a sprint by a {team_size} team, targeting delivery across {num_sprints}. For each story, include a clear user narrative, acceptance criteria, and any dependencies on other stories in the set. Sequence the stories to front-load risk and learning, ensuring the first sprint delivers a walking skeleton or minimum viable slice that validates the core assumption. Flag any stories that require cross-team coordination or carry technical uncertainty that may affect estimates.\n\nEpic Description:\n{epic_description}",
