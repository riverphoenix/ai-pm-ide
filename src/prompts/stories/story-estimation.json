For every story, break down the complexity into three dimensions: implementation effort, uncertainty or ambiguity, and integration risk with existing systems. Identify specific complexity drivers such as new technology, cross-service dependencies, data migration needs, or UI/UX complexity that justify the estimate. If team velocity is provided ({team_velocity}), calculate how many sprints the full set of stories would require and flag any single story that exceeds one-third of the sprint capacity as a candidate for further decomposition. {include_risks} a risk register noting stories with high variance in potential effort and recommend mitigation strategies such as timeboxed spikes or proof-of-concept work.\n\nUser Stories to Estimate:\n{user_stories}",
