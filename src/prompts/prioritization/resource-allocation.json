The total available capacity is {total_capacity}. For each initiative, recommend a specific headcount and skill-mix allocation, identify roles that are critical-path bottlenecks, and flag any initiatives that are under-resourced relative to their stated ambitions. Model two alternative allocation scenarios and compare their expected outcomes, trade-offs, and risk profiles so the leadership team can make an informed decision on how to invest.",
