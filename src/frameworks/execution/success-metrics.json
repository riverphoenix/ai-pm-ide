We will know we have succeeded when context-enhanced generation becomes the default behavior for active users.\n\n---\n\n## Primary Success Metrics\n\nThese are the 3 metrics that directly measure whether this initiative achieved its goal.\n\n### 1. Framework Output Quality Score\n- **Definition**: Average user rating (1-5 scale) on AI-generated framework outputs when product context documents are uploaded\n- **Measurement Method**: In-app rating prompt after each generation (\"How useful was this output?\")\n- **Baseline**: 3.2/5.0 (without context documents)\n- **Target**: 4.2/5.0 (with context documents)\n- **Minimum Viable Threshold**: 3.8/5.0 (below this, the feature does not add sufficient value)\n- **Data Source**: Mixpanel event tracking + PostgreSQL ratings table\n- **Measurement Frequency**: Daily aggregation, weekly review\n\n### 2. Context Upload Adoption Rate\n- **Definition**: Percentage of active users who upload at least one context document to a project within their first 14 days\n- **Measurement Method**: Funnel analysis: account creation > project creation > document upload\n- **Baseline**: 0% (feature not yet launched)\n- **Target**: 45% of active users\n- **Minimum Viable Threshold**: 25% (below this, discoverability or value proposition is unclear)\n- **Data Source**: Mixpanel funnel + S3 upload logs\n- **Measurement Frequency**: Weekly cohort analysis\n\n### 3. Weekly Frameworks Generated per Active User\n- **Definition**: Average number of frameworks generated per user who had at least one session that week\n- **Measurement Method**: Count of generation events / weekly active users\n- **Baseline**: 1.2 frameworks/user/week (current, without context feature)\n- **Target**: 2.8 frameworks/user/week\n- **Minimum Viable Threshold**: 2.0 frameworks/user/week\n- **Data Source**: Mixpanel product analytics\n- **Measurement Frequency**: Weekly\n\n---\n\n## Leading Indicators\n\nThese early signals will tell us within the first 2-4 weeks whether we are on track toward our primary metrics.\n\n| Indicator | What It Signals | Target | Check-In |\n|---|---|---|---|\n| Day 1 context upload rate | Is the upload flow discoverable and intuitive? | >15% of new users | Week 1 |\n| Avg. documents uploaded per project | Are users investing in context quality? | >2.0 docs/project | Week 2 |\n| Generation completion rate (with context) | Does context-enhanced generation work reliably? | >95% | Week 1 |\n| Time to first context-enhanced generation | How fast do users experience the core value? | <8 minutes from signup | Week 2 |\n| Qualitative feedback sentiment | What are users saying in feedback forms? | >60% positive | Week 3 |\n| Support ticket volume related to uploads | Is the feature causing confusion? | <5 tickets/week | Week 2 |\n\n---\n\n## Lagging Indicators\n\nThese metrics confirm long-term success and will become meaningful 4-8 weeks after launch.\n\n| Indicator | What It Confirms | Target | Check-In |\n|---|---|---|---|\n| Day 30 retention (context users vs. non-context) | Does context usage drive stickiness? | Context users: 35% vs. Non-context: 18% | Week 8 |\n| NPS score (context users) | Are context users more satisfied? | NPS >= 50 for context users | Week 8 |\n| Organic referral rate | Are users recommending the feature? | 8% of new signups from referral links | Week 10 |\n| Free-to-paid conversion (context users) | Does context usage drive monetization? | Context users convert at 2x rate of non-context | Week 12 |\n\n---\n\n## Guardrail Metrics\n\nMetrics that must NOT degrade as we pursue success. If any guardrail is breached, we pause and investigate before continuing.\n\n| Guardrail | Threshold | Why It Matters | Escalation |\n|---|---|---|---|\n| Overall generation success rate | Must not drop below 92% | Adding context parsing must not break the core flow | Immediate engineering fix; rollback if unresolved in 24h |\n| P95 generation latency | Must stay under 8 seconds | Context processing must not make the product feel slow | Performance optimization sprint |\n| LLM cost per generation | Must stay under $0.10 | Context-enhanced prompts are larger; costs must remain viable | Implement caching or prompt compression |\n| Non-context generation quality | Must not decrease from 3.2 baseline | Improving context mode must not degrade the default experience | Investigate prompt regression |\n\n---\n\n## Measurement Plan\n\n### Data Collection\n\n| Data Point | Collection Method | Instrumentation Needed | Owner |\n|---|---|---|---|\n| Framework generation events | Mixpanel track event | Add context_documents_count property | Engineering |\n| Output quality ratings | In-app survey component | Build rating modal post-generation | Product + Engineering |\n| Document upload events | S3 upload webhook + Mixpanel | Track upload_success, upload_failure, doc_type | Engineering |\n| Support tickets | Intercom tagging | Add \"context-upload\" tag category | Support |\n| User interviews | Calendly scheduling | Recruit 10 beta users for Week 3 interviews | Product |\n\n### Analysis Schedule\n\n| Timeframe | Analysis | Owner | Output |\n|---|---|---|---|\n| Daily | Monitor guardrail metrics dashboard | Engineering on-call | Slack alert if breached |\n| Weekly | Review leading indicators, update scorecard | PM (Sarah) | Weekly metrics email to team |\n| Bi-weekly | Cohort analysis: context users vs. non-context | Data Analyst | Retention and conversion comparison |\n| Monthly | Full success metrics review with leadership | PM + Head of Product | Go/no-go decision on doubling down or pivoting |\n| End of Quarter | Comprehensive initiative retrospective | PM + full team | Success/failure determination; next steps |\n\n---\n\n## Decision Framework\n\nHow we will use these metrics to make decisions:\n\n| Scenario | Criteria | Decision |\n|---|---|---|\n| Strong success | All 3 primary metrics hit target; guardrails intact | Double down: increase investment, expand to more frameworks |\n| Partial success | 2 of 3 primary metrics hit minimum threshold; guardrails intact | Iterate: investigate the underperforming metric; run experiments |\n| Underperformance | Fewer than 2 primary metrics hit minimum threshold | Pivot: conduct user research to understand why; redefine approach |\n| Guardrail breach | Any guardrail metric crosses threshold | Pause: stop new development; fix the issue before proceeding |\n\n---\n\n## Stakeholder Reporting\n\n| Audience | What They See | Cadence | Format |\n|---|---|---|---|\n| Engineering team | Guardrails + leading indicators | Daily (Slack) | Automated dashboard alerts |\n| Product team | All metrics + qualitative feedback | Weekly | Metrics scorecard email |\n| Leadership | Primary metrics + decision recommendation | Bi-weekly | Slide deck (3 slides) |\n| Board / Investors | Primary metrics + strategic narrative | Quarterly | Investor update section |",
  "system_prompt": "You are a product analytics and measurement expert specializing in defining clear, actionable success metrics for product initiatives and features.\n\nYour task is to help the user define a complete success metrics framework for their initiative, ensuring they can objectively determine whether the work achieved its goals.\n\n## Methodology:\n\nFollow a structured approach to success metrics definition:\n\n1. **Initiative Overview**: Clearly state what is being measured, who owns it, the timeframe, and the core objective in one sentence.\n\n2. **Success Statement**: Write a 2-3 sentence narrative description of what success looks like. This should be understandable by anyone in the company.\n\n3. **Primary Success Metrics (3 metrics)**: Define exactly 3 metrics that directly measure whether the initiative achieved its goal. For each metric, specify:\n   - Precise definition (no ambiguity in how it is calculated)\n   - Measurement method (how data is collected)\n   - Current baseline\n   - Target value\n   - Minimum viable threshold (the floor below which the initiative is considered unsuccessful)\n   - Data source\n   - Measurement frequency\n\n4. **Leading Indicators (5-7 metrics)**: Early signals visible within 2-4 weeks that predict whether primary metrics will be hit. Include target values and the week by which each should be checked.\n\n5. **Lagging Indicators (3-5 metrics)**: Long-term confirmation metrics that validate sustained success after 4-12 weeks. These confirm the initiative created lasting value.\n\n6. **Guardrail Metrics (3-5 metrics)**: Metrics that must NOT degrade while pursuing success. Define hard thresholds and escalation actions if breached.\n\n7. **Measurement Plan**: Detail the data collection infrastructure needed, instrumentation requirements, ownership, and analysis schedule from daily monitoring to quarterly review.\n\n8. **Decision Framework**: Define explicit criteria for four scenarios: strong success, partial success, underperformance, and guardrail breach. Each scenario should map to a clear decision (double down, iterate, pivot, or pause).\n\n9. **Stakeholder Reporting**: Define what each audience sees, how often, and in what format.\n\n## Best Practices:\n- Every metric must have a precise, unambiguous definition. If two people could calculate it differently, it is not well-defined.\n- Always include a minimum viable threshold, not just a target. This separates \"stretch goal\" from \"failure.\"\n- Leading indicators are essential for early course correction. Do not skip them.\n- Guardrail metrics prevent unintended consequences and gaming. Always include them.\n- The measurement plan must be realistic. If you cannot instrument a metric, you cannot use it.\n- Include both quantitative metrics and qualitative signals (user interviews, feedback sentiment).\n- The decision framework removes ambiguity: before you launch, agree on what each outcome means.\n- Use markdown tables extensively for structured, scannable output.",
