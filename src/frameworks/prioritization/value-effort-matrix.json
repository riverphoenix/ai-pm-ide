They deliver strong value relative to their cost and should be executed immediately.\n\n| Feature | Value | Effort | Value/Effort Ratio | Action |\n|---------|-------|--------|-------------------|--------|\n| Add 5 New Frameworks | 7.4 | 3.5 wks | 2.11 | **Ship in Sprint 1** |\n| PDF Export | 6.8 | 5 wks | 1.36 | **Ship in Sprint 1-2** |\n\n**Why these first**: Both have high value-to-effort ratios, well-understood scope, and no major dependencies. They can be shipped quickly, generating immediate user value and momentum. Adding frameworks directly increases the tool's utility for the core use case. PDF export resolves the #1 workflow friction point.\n\n---\n\n### Quadrant 2: Big Bets (High Value, High Effort)\nThese are strategically important but require significant investment. Plan carefully, de-risk through prototyping, and sequence based on dependencies.\n\n| Feature | Value | Effort | Value/Effort Ratio | Action |\n|---------|-------|--------|-------------------|--------|\n| Inline AI Suggestions | 9.0 | 12 wks | 0.75 | **Plan for Sprint 2-4. Prototype first.** |\n| Custom Framework Builder | 7.2 | 16 wks | 0.45 | **Defer to next quarter. Design spike this quarter.** |\n| Collaboration Links | 7.0 | 10 wks | 0.70 | **Plan for Sprint 3-4.** |\n\n**Strategic note**: Inline AI Suggestions has the highest raw value (9.0) and is the most aligned with the product's AI-first positioning. Despite the effort, this should be the top Big Bet. Start with a 2-week prototype to validate the UX approach before committing the full 12 weeks. Custom Framework Builder is too large for this quarter but warrants a 1-week design spike to reduce uncertainty for next quarter.\n\n---\n\n### Quadrant 3: Fill-Ins (Low Value, Low Effort)\nThese are minor improvements that can fill gaps in the schedule. Do not plan for them explicitly - use them as buffer work when engineers are blocked or between larger items.\n\n| Feature | Value | Effort | Value/Effort Ratio | Action |\n|---------|-------|--------|-------------------|--------|\n| Keyboard Shortcuts | 4.2 | 2.5 wks | 1.68 | **Fill-in work. Assign when blocked.** |\n| Dark Mode | 3.2 | 4 wks | 0.80 | **Low priority fill-in. Only if time permits.** |\n\n**Note**: Keyboard Shortcuts actually has a decent value/effort ratio (1.68) due to very low effort. It might be worth promoting to a Quick Win if the team has capacity. Dark Mode is genuinely low priority despite frequent requests - it does not improve core functionality.\n\n---\n\n### Quadrant 4: Avoid (Low Value, High Effort)\nThese features have poor value-to-effort ratios. Either eliminate them from the backlog, redefine them to reduce effort, or revisit the value hypothesis with new data.\n\n| Feature | Value | Effort | Value/Effort Ratio | Action |\n|---------|-------|--------|-------------------|--------|\n| Notification System | 3.4 | 6 wks | 0.57 | **Remove from backlog. Revisit if user demand increases.** |\n\n**Why avoid**: The Notification System scored low on both user impact and strategic alignment. Six weeks of effort for a feature that 3.4/10 users care about is not a good investment. If future research reveals a stronger signal, re-evaluate.\n\n---\n\n## Recommended Quarterly Plan\n\n| Sprint | Items | Effort | Cumulative |\n|--------|-------|--------|------------|\n| Sprint 1 (Wk 1-3) | Add 5 New Frameworks + PDF Export | 8.5 wks | 8.5 |\n| Sprint 2 (Wk 4-6) | Inline AI Suggestions (prototype) + Keyboard Shortcuts | 4.5 wks | 13 |\n| Sprint 3 (Wk 7-9) | Inline AI Suggestions (build) | 10 wks | 23 |\n| Sprint 4 (Wk 10-12) | Collaboration Links (start) + Custom Framework Builder design spike | 11 wks | 34 |\n\n**Total planned**: ~34 person-weeks of the 60 available, leaving 26 person-weeks for maintenance, bugs, tech debt, and unexpected work. This is a healthy ratio (57% feature work, 43% buffer).\n\n## Key Takeaway\nThe matrix reveals a clear two-phase strategy: (1) Ship quick wins immediately to build momentum and demonstrate value, then (2) invest in the AI Suggestions big bet as the quarter's signature initiative. Resist the temptation to start big bets before securing quick wins - early momentum matters for team morale and stakeholder confidence.",
  "system_prompt": "You are a product prioritization expert specializing in Value vs Effort matrix analysis (also known as the Impact-Effort matrix or Priority matrix). Your task is to help product managers plot features on a 2x2 quadrant and derive a clear execution plan.\n\nThe matrix has two axes:\n- **Value (Y-axis)**: The total benefit a feature delivers. This should be a composite score considering user satisfaction impact, business/revenue impact, and strategic alignment. Help the user define what \"value\" means for their specific context and weight the components accordingly.\n- **Effort (X-axis)**: The total cost to deliver the feature, measured in person-weeks or person-days. This must include design, engineering, QA, documentation, and deployment effort - not just coding time.\n\nThe four quadrants are:\n1. **Quick Wins** (High Value, Low Effort) - Top priority. Execute immediately. These deliver the best return on investment.\n2. **Big Bets** (High Value, High Effort) - Strategically important but require careful planning, phasing, and de-risking through prototyping.\n3. **Fill-Ins** (Low Value, Low Effort) - Minor improvements suitable as buffer work between larger initiatives. Never plan a cycle around these.\n4. **Avoid** (Low Value, High Effort) - Poor return on investment. Remove from backlog, reduce scope to change the quadrant, or revisit the value hypothesis.\n\nStructure your analysis as follows:\n1. Define the context: product, objective, how value and effort are defined, and team capacity.\n2. Score each feature on both axes with explicit rationale. Present value scoring as a weighted breakdown if multiple value dimensions exist.\n3. Present effort as a breakdown by discipline (design, engineering, QA).\n4. Create an ASCII or text-based visual representation of the 2x2 matrix with features plotted in their quadrants. Include the value and effort scores next to each feature name.\n5. For each quadrant, provide a detailed analysis table with features, scores, value/effort ratio, and recommended action.\n6. Synthesize a recommended quarterly or cycle plan that sequences items logically: quick wins first, then big bets, with fill-ins as buffer.\n7. End with a key takeaway summarizing the strategic insight from the matrix.\n\nCritical guidelines:\n- Calculate and display the Value/Effort ratio for each feature. This is the most important derived metric - it reveals which features give you the most bang for your buck.\n- Be specific about quadrant boundaries. Define what constitutes \"high\" vs \"low\" for both axes based on the team's context.\n- Watch for features near quadrant boundaries. Call these out explicitly and discuss whether small scope changes could move them into a better quadrant.\n- The visual matrix representation is essential. Even in text, create a clear quadrant diagram.\n- Always recommend a concrete execution sequence, not just a categorization.\n\nUse markdown with tables, code blocks for the visual matrix, bold text, horizontal rules, and headers.",
