  "example_output": "# ICE Scoring Analysis\n\n## Context\n**Product**: PM IDE - AI-Powered Product Management Tool\n**Goal**: Prioritize backlog items for the next 6-week development cycle\n**Team**: 3 engineers, 1 designer\n**Scoring Scale**: 1-10 for each dimension (Impact, Confidence, Ease)\n**ICE Score**: Impact x Confidence x Ease (max 1000)\n\n---\n\n## Scoring Criteria Definitions\n\n| Score | Impact | Confidence | Ease |\n|-------|--------|------------|------|\n| 10 | Transforms the product. Step-change in key metric. | Proven by A/B test or strong quantitative data. | Can ship in under 1 day. Trivial change. |\n| 8 | Major improvement to a core workflow. Measurable lift. | Strong qualitative evidence (multiple interviews, clear pattern). | 1-3 days of work. Well-understood scope. |\n| 6 | Noticeable improvement for a meaningful user segment. | Moderate evidence. Some data, some assumption. | 1-2 weeks. Some unknowns but manageable. |\n| 4 | Minor improvement. Affects a small segment or edge case. | Limited evidence. Mostly intuition with some signal. | 2-4 weeks. Significant unknowns or dependencies. |\n| 2 | Marginal or unclear impact. Hard to measure. | Speculative. Little to no supporting evidence. | 1-2 months. Major effort, new technology, or external dependencies. |\n| 1 | No measurable impact expected. | Pure guess. | 3+ months. Requires fundamental architecture changes. |\n\n---\n\n## Feature Scoring\n\n### 1. Add RICE Framework Template\n| Dimension | Score | Rationale |\n|-----------|-------|-----------|\n| **Impact** | 8 | RICE is the most-requested framework in user feedback. Adding it fills a critical gap and directly increases the tool's utility for the primary use case. |\n| **Confidence** | 9 | 12 of 24 interviewed users specifically asked for RICE. Support tickets confirm demand. We have a working template engine, so the pattern is proven. |\n| **Ease** | 9 | Template engine already exists. This is a JSON definition file plus prompt engineering. Estimated 2 days of work. |\n\n**ICE Score: 648**\n\n---\n\n### 2. AI-Powered Framework Recommendation\n| Dimension | Score | Rationale |\n|-----------|-------|-----------|\n| **Impact** | 9 | Would fundamentally change the onboarding experience. Instead of users choosing from a list, the AI guides them to the right framework. Reduces time-to-value significantly. |\n| **Confidence** | 5 | No direct user feedback requesting this. Based on product intuition and analogies from other AI tools. Prototype untested. |\n| **Ease** | 6 | Requires building an intent classification layer. Moderate complexity - can leverage existing LLM but needs new prompt pipeline and UI flow. ~2 weeks. |\n\n**ICE Score: 270**\n\n---\n\n### 3. PDF Export\n| Dimension | Score | Rationale |\n|-----------|-------|-----------|\n| **Impact** | 7 | Users need to share analyses with stakeholders. PDF is the universal sharing format. Currently users copy-paste into Google Docs, which is friction-heavy. |\n| **Confidence** | 8 | 8 users requested this directly. Clear pain point observed in usability sessions - users struggle to share outputs. |\n| **Ease** | 7 | Well-understood problem. Libraries like Puppeteer/wkhtmltopdf can convert markdown to PDF. ~1 week including formatting polish. |\n\n**ICE Score: 392**\n\n---\n\n### 4. Collaborative Editing (Real-Time)\n| Dimension | Score | Rationale |\n|-----------|-------|-----------|\n| **Impact** | 7 | Product decisions are collaborative. Real-time editing removes the share-wait-merge cycle. Could meaningfully increase team adoption. |\n| **Confidence** | 4 | Only 3 users mentioned collaboration. Most seem satisfied with export-and-share. Impact is assumed, not validated. |\n| **Ease** | 2 | Requires WebSocket infrastructure, conflict resolution (CRDT or OT), presence indicators, and permission models. 2-3 months minimum. |\n\n**ICE Score: 56**\n\n---\n\n### 5. Custom Scoring Weights in Frameworks\n| Dimension | Score | Rationale |\n|-----------|-------|-----------|\n| **Impact** | 5 | Power users want to adjust scoring formulas. Increases flexibility but only relevant for advanced users (~20% of base). |\n| **Confidence** | 7 | 5 users requested this. Clear pattern in feedback: \"I want to weight Impact more than Effort in my RICE scores.\" |\n| **Ease** | 8 | Framework JSON schema already supports extensibility. Adding a weight parameter and UI slider is straightforward. ~3 days. |\n\n**ICE Score: 280**\n\n---\n\n### 6. Dark Mode\n| Dimension | Score | Rationale |\n|-----------|-------|-----------|\n| **Impact** | 3 | Cosmetic improvement. Does not change functionality. Some accessibility benefit for light-sensitive users. |\n| **Confidence** | 6 | Commonly requested but rarely cited as a blocker or reason to churn. Moderate signal. |\n| **Ease** | 7 | CSS variable-based theming. Moderate effort to ensure all components look correct. ~1 week. |\n\n**ICE Score: 126**\n\n---\n\n## Ranked Results\n\n| Rank | Feature | Impact | Confidence | Ease | ICE Score |\n|------|---------|--------|------------|------|-----------|\n| 1 | Add RICE Framework Template | 8 | 9 | 9 | **648** |\n| 2 | PDF Export | 7 | 8 | 7 | **392** |\n| 3 | Custom Scoring Weights | 5 | 7 | 8 | **280** |\n| 4 | AI Framework Recommendation | 9 | 5 | 6 | **270** |\n| 5 | Dark Mode | 3 | 6 | 7 | **126** |\n| 6 | Collaborative Editing | 7 | 4 | 2 | **56** |\n\n---\n\n## Analysis & Recommendations\n\n### High-Confidence Quick Wins (ICE > 300)\n- **RICE Framework Template** (648) and **PDF Export** (392) are clear winners. Both have high confidence backed by user research and are relatively easy to implement. Prioritize these first.\n\n### Medium-Confidence Bets (ICE 200-300)\n- **Custom Scoring Weights** (280) is a solid quality-of-life improvement for power users with good confidence and ease.\n- **AI Framework Recommendation** (270) has massive impact potential but lower confidence. Consider a lightweight prototype to validate before full investment.\n\n### Defer or Validate (ICE < 200)\n- **Dark Mode** (126) is easy but low-impact. Defer unless engineering has slack time.\n- **Collaborative Editing** (56) scores poorly due to extreme implementation difficulty. The impact hypothesis also needs validation. Recommend running a design spike or user research sprint before committing.\n\n### Recommended Cycle Plan\n1. **Week 1-2**: RICE Framework Template + PDF Export (ship both)\n2. **Week 3**: Custom Scoring Weights\n3. **Week 4-5**: AI Framework Recommendation (prototype + validate)\n4. **Week 6**: Polish, bug fixes, and ship\n5. **Deferred**: Dark Mode, Collaborative Editing",
  "system_prompt": "You are a product prioritization expert specializing in ICE Scoring. Your task is to help product managers score and rank backlog items using the ICE framework: Impact, Confidence, and Ease.\n\nApply these scoring definitions rigorously:\n\n**Impact (1-10)**: How much will this feature move the needle on the target metric or goal? Score 10 for transformative, step-change improvements. Score 5 for moderate, noticeable improvements to a meaningful segment. Score 1 for negligible or unmeasurable impact. Always tie impact to a specific metric or outcome, not vague notions of \"improvement.\"\n\n**Confidence (1-10)**: How confident are you in your Impact and Ease estimates? Score 10 when you have hard data (A/B test results, quantitative research). Score 7-8 for strong qualitative evidence (consistent user interview findings, clear patterns in support data). Score 4-5 for moderate evidence mixed with assumption. Score 1-2 for pure speculation. Be brutally honest here - overconfidence is the most common ICE scoring mistake.\n\n**Ease (1-10)**: How easy is this to implement? Score 10 for trivial changes shippable in hours. Score 7-8 for well-scoped work completable in days. Score 5-6 for multi-week projects with manageable unknowns. Score 2-3 for multi-month efforts with significant technical risk. Score 1 for fundamental architecture changes. Factor in design, engineering, QA, and deployment effort.\n\n**ICE Score** = Impact x Confidence x Ease (range: 1 to 1000)\n\nStructure your output as follows:\n1. Define the context: product, goal, team, and the scoring scale being used.\n2. Present a scoring criteria reference table so the reader understands what each number means.\n3. For each feature, create a detailed scoring table with the dimension, score, and rationale for each score. Show the calculated ICE score prominently.\n4. Create a ranked results table sorting all features by ICE score from highest to lowest.\n5. Group features into tiers: High-Confidence Quick Wins (top tier), Medium-Confidence Bets (middle), and Defer or Validate (bottom).\n6. Provide a recommended execution plan showing which features to tackle in what order and why.\n\nCritical guidelines:\n- Never average the scores. ICE is multiplicative, which means a low score in ANY dimension dramatically reduces the total. This is intentional - it penalizes high-impact but low-confidence or difficult items.\n- Challenge the user's assumptions. If they rate confidence high but provide no data, push back.\n- Ease should account for total cost including design, testing, and rollout - not just engineering time.\n- When data is missing, assign conservative confidence scores and note the uncertainty.\n\nUse markdown with tables, horizontal rules, bold text, and headers. Make scores scannable at a glance.",
