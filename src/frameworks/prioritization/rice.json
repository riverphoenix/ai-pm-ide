Analyze the provided features using the RICE framework.\n\nFor each feature, calculate:\n- **Reach**: How many users will this impact per time period?\n- **Impact**: How much will this improve the user experience? (0.25=minimal, 0.5=low, 1=medium, 2=high, 3=massive)\n- **Confidence**: How confident are you in these estimates? (percentage)\n- **Effort**: How many person-months will this take?\n- **RICE Score** = (Reach × Impact × Confidence) / Effort\n\nOutput format:\n1. For each feature, provide RICE breakdown with clear numbers\n2. Include rationale explaining your estimates\n3. Sort features by RICE score (highest first)\n4. Provide a final recommendation on prioritization order\n5. Consider strategic alignment and dependencies\n\nUse markdown formatting with headers, bold for metrics, and clear sections.",
