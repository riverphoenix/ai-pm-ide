  "example_output": "# Sprint 14 Planning: AI PM Workspace\n\n## Sprint Overview\n- **Sprint Duration**: 2 weeks (Feb 17 - Feb 28, 2026)\n- **Sprint Goal**: Deliver the AI-powered framework recommendation engine and improve export functionality\n- **Team Capacity**: 42 story points (7 engineers x 8 pts avg, minus 2 PTO days)\n- **Velocity (3-sprint avg)**: 38 points\n\n---\n\n## Sprint Goal Statement\n> By the end of this sprint, users will be able to receive AI-recommended frameworks based on their project context, and export any generated document to PDF and Markdown formats.\n\n**Why this matters**: Framework discovery is currently manual. Users browse 45+ templates without guidance. Recommendation reduces time-to-first-output from 5 minutes to under 30 seconds. Export has been the #1 requested feature in beta feedback (mentioned by 72% of respondents).\n\n---\n\n## Committed Backlog Items\n\n### High Priority (Must Complete)\n\n| ID | Story | Points | Owner | Acceptance Criteria |\n|----|-------|--------|-------|--------------------|\n| PM-201 | AI framework recommender - backend | 8 | Sarah L. | Given a project description, the system returns top 3 framework matches with confidence scores above 0.7 |\n| PM-202 | AI framework recommender - UI | 5 | James K. | Recommendation card displays on project dashboard; user can accept or dismiss |\n| PM-203 | PDF export for generated documents | 5 | Maria C. | All framework outputs export to PDF with correct formatting, headers, and page breaks |\n| PM-204 | Markdown export for generated documents | 3 | Maria C. | Export preserves all markdown syntax; file downloads with correct .md extension |\n\n### Medium Priority (Should Complete)\n\n| ID | Story | Points | Owner | Acceptance Criteria |\n|----|-------|--------|-------|--------------------|\n| PM-205 | Framework search and filtering | 5 | James K. | Users can search by name, category, and keyword; results update in real-time |\n| PM-206 | Recent frameworks quick-access panel | 3 | Alex R. | Last 5 used frameworks appear on dashboard; clicking opens with previous context preserved |\n| PM-207 | Onboarding tooltip flow for new users | 5 | Alex R. | 4-step tooltip sequence guides new users through project creation and first framework generation |\n\n### Stretch Goals (If Capacity Allows)\n\n| ID | Story | Points | Owner | Acceptance Criteria |\n|----|-------|--------|-------|--------------------|\n| PM-208 | Dark mode support | 5 | James K. | All screens render correctly in dark mode; toggle in settings persists across sessions |\n| PM-209 | Keyboard shortcuts for power users | 3 | Alex R. | Cmd+K opens command palette; 10 core shortcuts documented in help menu |\n\n**Total Committed**: 34 points | **Stretch**: 8 points | **Capacity**: 42 points\n\n---\n\n## Capacity & Availability\n\n| Team Member | Role | Availability | Notes |\n|-------------|------|-------------|-------|\n| Sarah L. | Backend Engineer | 100% | Leading recommender engine |\n| James K. | Frontend Engineer | 100% | UI work for recommender + search |\n| Maria C. | Full-Stack Engineer | 80% | PTO Feb 24-25 |\n| Alex R. | Frontend Engineer | 100% | Onboarding + quick-access panel |\n| Tom W. | QA Engineer | 100% | Testing all deliverables |\n| Lisa M. | Designer | 50% | Supporting recommender UI, shared with Team B |\n| David P. | Tech Lead | 30% | Code reviews + architecture guidance |\n\n---\n\n## Dependencies & Risks\n\n| Risk | Impact | Likelihood | Mitigation |\n|------|--------|-----------|------------|\n| LLM API latency for recommendations | Slow recommendation UX | Medium | Implement caching layer; pre-compute for common project types |\n| PDF rendering library compatibility | Export formatting issues | Low | Spike completed in Sprint 13; library validated |\n| Lisa's split availability | UI designs delayed | Medium | Prioritize recommender designs in Week 1; use existing design system for search |\n\n---\n\n## Definition of Done (Sprint Level)\n- [ ] All committed stories meet acceptance criteria\n- [ ] Code reviewed and merged to main branch\n- [ ] Unit test coverage above 80% for new code\n- [ ] QA sign-off on all user-facing changes\n- [ ] Documentation updated for new features\n- [ ] No P1 or P2 bugs remaining from sprint work\n\n---\n\n## Ceremonies\n- **Daily Standup**: 9:30 AM GMT, 15 minutes\n- **Mid-Sprint Review**: Feb 21, async check-in on progress\n- **Sprint Review/Demo**: Feb 28, 2:00 PM GMT\n- **Retrospective**: Feb 28, 3:00 PM GMT",
  "system_prompt": "You are an expert Agile coach and Scrum Master creating a sprint planning document.\n\nBased on the provided context, create a detailed sprint plan that the team can use as their single source of truth for the upcoming iteration.\n\n## Structure:\n\n1. **Sprint Overview**: Duration, sprint number, team capacity in story points, and historical velocity (3-sprint rolling average). State the dates clearly.\n\n2. **Sprint Goal Statement**: A single, clear sentence describing what the team will achieve. Follow with a \"Why this matters\" explanation connecting the goal to user value or business outcomes.\n\n3. **Committed Backlog Items**: Organize into priority tiers:\n   - **High Priority (Must Complete)**: Core items the team commits to delivering\n   - **Medium Priority (Should Complete)**: Important but can slip if blockers arise\n   - **Stretch Goals**: Only if capacity allows\n   For each item include: ID, story title, story points, owner, and acceptance criteria.\n\n4. **Capacity & Availability**: Table showing each team member, their role, availability percentage, and any notes (PTO, shared allocation, etc.).\n\n5. **Dependencies & Risks**: Identify cross-team dependencies, technical risks, and external blockers. Include impact, likelihood, and mitigation strategies.\n\n6. **Definition of Done (Sprint Level)**: Checklist of criteria that must be met before the sprint is considered complete.\n\n7. **Ceremonies**: List standup times, review dates, and retrospective schedule.\n\n## Guidelines:\n- Total committed points should not exceed 85-90% of capacity to allow for unplanned work\n- Each story must have clear, testable acceptance criteria\n- Flag any items that depend on work outside the team's control\n- Use tables for readability\n- Be specific about owners and dates\n- Include both the committed total and stretch total separately",
