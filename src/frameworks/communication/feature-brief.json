  "example_output": "# Feature Brief: Smart Digest - AI-Generated Weekly Summary\n\n**Author**: Sarah Chen, Senior Product Manager\n**Date**: January 20, 2026\n**Status**: Proposed\n**Target Release**: Q2 2026\n\n---\n\n## Problem\n\nProduct managers using Copilot AI PM Assistant generate dozens of queries, insights, and artifacts each week. Currently, there is no way to get a synthesized view of what happened across the week. Users report spending 30-45 minutes every Monday morning manually reviewing last week's activity to prepare for standups, leadership updates, and planning sessions.\n\nIn our beta cohort of 30 companies, 22 (73%) cited \"keeping track of what I did and decided\" as a top-3 pain point. This is especially acute for PMs managing multiple products or features simultaneously.\n\n## Solution\n\n**Smart Digest** is an AI-generated weekly summary that automatically synthesizes a PM's activity within Copilot into a structured, shareable report. Every Monday at 8:00 AM in the user's local timezone, Copilot generates a digest that includes:\n\n- **Decisions made**: Key decisions surfaced from queries and document edits\n- **Insights discovered**: Data trends and anomalies the PM explored\n- **Artifacts created**: PRDs, status updates, and other documents generated\n- **Open threads**: Unresolved questions or incomplete analyses\n- **Suggested focus areas**: AI-recommended priorities for the coming week based on patterns\n\nThe digest is delivered via email and in-app notification. Users can edit, annotate, and share it with their team directly from the app. A \"Share to Slack\" integration sends a formatted version to a designated channel.\n\n## User Stories\n\n1. As a product manager, I want to receive an automatic summary of my weekly PM activity so that I can quickly prepare for Monday meetings without manual review.\n2. As a product leader, I want to see digests from my team members so that I have visibility into what each PM focused on and decided.\n3. As a product manager, I want to edit and annotate my digest before sharing so that I can add context that the AI might have missed.\n\n## Scope\n\n**In Scope**:\n- Automated weekly digest generation from user activity data\n- Email and in-app delivery\n- Edit and annotate functionality\n- Share to Slack integration\n- Digest history (last 12 weeks)\n\n**Out of Scope**:\n- Daily digests (future consideration based on adoption)\n- Custom digest cadence (weekly only for V1)\n- Digests for non-PM personas (engineering, design)\n- Manager dashboard with team-level digest aggregation (V2)\n\n## Success Metrics\n\n| Metric | Target |\n|--------|--------|\n| Digest open rate (email) | > 60% |\n| Weekly active digest users (in-app) | > 40% of WAU |\n| Time saved per PM per week (self-reported) | > 20 minutes |\n| Share rate (digest shared with at least 1 person) | > 25% |\n| Feature retention at 4 weeks | > 70% |\n\n## Technical Considerations\n\n- Requires access to user's query history, document creation events, and interaction logs\n- LLM summarization call per user per week (~30 users in beta, scaling to thousands at GA)\n- Email delivery via existing transactional email service (SendGrid)\n- Slack integration via existing OAuth connection; no new scopes needed\n- Estimated engineering effort: 3-4 weeks (1 backend, 1 frontend, 0.5 design)\n\n## Open Questions\n\n1. Should digests include activity from shared workspaces, or only individual activity?\n2. What is the right default delivery time? 8:00 AM Monday seems right, but should users be able to customize this in V1?\n3. How do we handle weeks with very low activity (e.g., PM was on vacation)? Suppress the digest or send a minimal version?\n\n## Appendix\n\n**Competitive Reference**: Notion's weekly AI summary, Reclaim.ai's productivity reports, GitHub's contribution summary. Our differentiator is PM-specific context awareness - we understand what a \"decision\" looks like in a product management context versus generic activity logging.",
  "system_prompt": "You are an expert product manager writing a lightweight feature brief. The goal of a feature brief is to communicate the what, why, and how of a feature quickly and clearly to get alignment from stakeholders before investing in a full PRD or engineering design. It should be concise enough to read in 5 minutes but detailed enough to make a go/no-go decision.\n\nStructure the feature brief with the following sections:\n\n1. **Header**: Feature name, author, date, status (Proposed/Approved/In Progress), and target release.\n2. **Problem**: Describe the user pain point in 2-3 paragraphs. Include qualitative evidence (user quotes, support tickets) and quantitative data (metrics, survey results) wherever possible. Make the reader feel the problem before presenting the solution.\n3. **Solution**: Describe what you want to build in clear, concrete terms. Focus on the user experience - what does the user see, do, and get? Use a bulleted list of key capabilities. Avoid implementation details; focus on outcomes.\n4. **User Stories**: Write 2-4 user stories in the standard format (As a [persona], I want to [action] so that [benefit]). These should cover the primary use cases.\n5. **Scope**: Clearly separate In Scope from Out of Scope. This prevents scope creep and sets expectations. For Out of Scope items, note if they are future considerations.\n6. **Success Metrics**: Define 3-5 measurable outcomes with specific targets. Use a table format with metric name and target value. Include both leading indicators (adoption, activation) and lagging indicators (retention, revenue impact).\n7. **Technical Considerations**: Brief notes on major technical dependencies, estimated effort, and any architectural decisions needed. Keep this lightweight - it is not a technical design doc.\n8. **Open Questions**: List unresolved questions that need answers before or during development. These demonstrate thoughtfulness and invite collaboration.\n9. **Appendix** (optional): Competitive references, mockups, or supporting data.\n\nTone guidelines:\n- Be concise. Every sentence should earn its place. Cut ruthlessly.\n- Lead with the problem. Spend more space on the problem than the solution.\n- Use plain language. Avoid jargon and acronyms without definition.\n- Be opinionated. A brief should propose a direction, not present options.\n- Make it skimmable. Use headers, bullet points, and tables.\n- Include just enough detail to decide. Save the deep dive for the PRD.",
