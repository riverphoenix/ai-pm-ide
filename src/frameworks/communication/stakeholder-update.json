  "example_output": "# Stakeholder Update: Copilot AI PM Assistant\n\n**Date**: January 15, 2026\n**Author**: Sarah Chen, Senior Product Manager\n**Distribution**: Leadership, Engineering, Design, GTM\n\n---\n\n## TL;DR\n\nCopilot AI PM Assistant is on track for its Q1 beta launch. We completed the natural language query engine ahead of schedule, onboarded 12 beta design partners, and resolved a critical latency issue in the suggestion pipeline. The primary risk is third-party LLM API rate limits during peak usage, which the engineering team is actively mitigating with a caching layer.\n\n---\n\n## Overall Status: \ud83d\udfe2 On Track\n\n| Area | Status | Details |\n|------|--------|---------|\n| Engineering | \ud83d\udfe2 On Track | Core query engine shipped; caching layer in progress |\n| Design | \ud83d\udfe1 Minor Risk | Usability testing delayed by 3 days due to recruiter availability |\n| GTM | \ud83d\udfe2 On Track | Beta partner onboarding ahead of schedule |\n| Data/Analytics | \ud83d\udfe2 On Track | Telemetry pipeline deployed to staging |\n\n---\n\n## Key Accomplishments (Last 2 Weeks)\n\n1. **Natural Language Query Engine shipped to staging** - Users can now ask questions like \"Show me features that missed their deadline last quarter\" and receive structured results from the product data warehouse. Early testing shows 87% query accuracy.\n\n2. **12 beta design partners onboarded** - Exceeded our target of 10. Partners include 4 enterprise companies (500+ seats), 5 mid-market, and 3 startups. Initial feedback is very positive around the AI-generated sprint summaries.\n\n3. **P0 latency issue resolved** - The suggestion pipeline was averaging 4.2s response time. Root cause was redundant embedding re-computation. After optimization, p95 latency is now 1.1s, well within our 2s SLA.\n\n4. **Telemetry and analytics pipeline deployed** - We can now track feature adoption, query success rates, and user satisfaction scores in real time via our internal dashboard.\n\n---\n\n## Upcoming Milestones (Next 2 Weeks)\n\n| Milestone | Target Date | Owner | Confidence |\n|-----------|-------------|-------|------------|\n| Usability testing round 1 complete | Jan 22 | Design (Alex) | High |\n| Caching layer deployed to production | Jan 24 | Eng (Priya) | High |\n| Beta launch to design partners | Jan 29 | PM (Sarah) | High |\n| Pricing model draft for review | Jan 31 | PM + Finance | Medium |\n\n---\n\n## Risks & Mitigations\n\n| Risk | Severity | Likelihood | Mitigation |\n|------|----------|------------|------------|\n| LLM API rate limits during peak usage | High | Medium | Building response caching layer; negotiating higher rate limits with provider |\n| Beta partner churn before GA | Medium | Low | Weekly check-ins with dedicated CSM; rapid feedback loops |\n| Pricing model misalignment with value | Medium | Medium | Running willingness-to-pay surveys with beta partners in parallel |\n\n---\n\n## Metrics Snapshot\n\n- **Query accuracy**: 87% (target: 90% by GA)\n- **p95 latency**: 1.1s (target: <2s)\n- **Beta partners onboarded**: 12/10 (target exceeded)\n- **NPS from alpha testers**: 62 (target: 50+)\n\n---\n\n## Decisions Needed\n\n1. **Pricing tier structure**: Should we offer a free tier with limited queries, or start with paid-only? Finance and GTM alignment needed by Jan 25.\n2. **SOC 2 certification timeline**: Enterprise partners are asking about compliance. Do we prioritize this for GA or post-launch? Need leadership input.\n\n---\n\n## Key Takeaway\n\nWe are in a strong position for the Q1 beta launch. The product is performing well technically, partner interest is strong, and the team is executing with high velocity. The main open items are pricing strategy and compliance timeline, both of which need cross-functional decisions in the next two weeks.",
  "system_prompt": "You are an expert product manager preparing a stakeholder update. Your goal is to create a clear, scannable, and honest status report that keeps leadership and cross-functional partners informed without requiring a meeting.\n\nStructure the update with the following sections:\n\n1. **Header**: Include the product/project name, date, author, and distribution list.\n2. **TL;DR**: A 2-3 sentence executive summary that captures the most important information. Busy stakeholders should be able to read only this and understand the current state.\n3. **Overall Status**: Use a traffic light system (\ud83d\udfe2 On Track, \ud83d\udfe1 Minor Risk, \ud83d\udd34 At Risk) for each workstream (Engineering, Design, GTM, etc.). Include a brief one-line explanation for each.\n4. **Key Accomplishments**: 3-5 bullet points covering what was completed since the last update. Be specific with numbers, dates, and outcomes rather than vague statements.\n5. **Upcoming Milestones**: A table with milestone name, target date, owner, and confidence level. This gives stakeholders forward visibility.\n6. **Risks & Mitigations**: A table listing active risks with severity, likelihood, and what is being done about each. Be transparent about problems rather than hiding them.\n7. **Metrics Snapshot**: Key performance indicators with current values and targets. Include only the 3-6 most important metrics.\n8. **Decisions Needed**: Clearly list any decisions that require stakeholder input, with context and deadlines. This is the call-to-action section.\n9. **Key Takeaway**: A brief closing paragraph summarizing the overall trajectory.\n\nTone guidelines:\n- Be direct and factual. Avoid filler language and corporate jargon.\n- Use data wherever possible. Replace \"things are going well\" with specific metrics.\n- Be honest about risks. Stakeholders trust updates that acknowledge challenges.\n- Keep it scannable with headers, tables, and bullet points. Assume readers have 2 minutes.\n- Write in active voice. Name specific owners for action items.\n- Avoid burying bad news. If something is off track, say so clearly and explain the plan.",
