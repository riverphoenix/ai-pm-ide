  "example_output": "# Product Vision: Copilot AI PM Assistant\n\n**Author**: Sarah Chen, Senior Product Manager\n**Date**: January 2026\n**Time Horizon**: 3 Years (2026-2029)\n\n---\n\n## Vision Statement\n\n**Every product manager deserves an intelligent partner that handles the operational burden of product management, so they can focus entirely on what matters most: understanding customers and making great product decisions.**\n\nCopilot AI PM Assistant will become the indispensable AI-powered workspace for product managers worldwide. Within three years, Copilot will transform product management from a discipline weighed down by reporting, data gathering, and administrative overhead into one where every PM operates at the strategic level - regardless of their experience or team size.\n\n---\n\n## The World Today\n\nProduct management is broken in a specific and measurable way. Research from our discovery phase reveals a stark reality:\n\n- **PMs spend only 28% of their time on strategic work** (customer research, roadmap decisions, cross-functional strategy). The remaining 72% goes to status updates, data pulling, meeting prep, and documentation.\n- **The average PM manages 4.3 communication channels** for stakeholder updates, leading to fragmented context and duplicated effort.\n- **63% of PMs report feeling reactive rather than proactive**, constantly responding to requests for information instead of driving product direction.\n- **New PMs take 6+ months to become fully effective**, not because the work is inherently complex, but because the tooling and processes are.\n\nThe tools available today - spreadsheets, project trackers, document editors, analytics dashboards - are generic. They were not built for how product managers think and work. PMs spend their days context-switching between a dozen tools, manually synthesizing information that should be at their fingertips.\n\n---\n\n## The World We Are Building\n\nWe envision a future where product managers are the most strategically impactful people in their organizations - not because they work harder, but because AI handles the operational complexity on their behalf.\n\n### Year 1 (2026): The Intelligent Assistant\n\nCopilot answers any product question instantly. A PM can ask \"What did our enterprise churn look like last quarter and why?\" and get a synthesized answer pulling from analytics, support tickets, and CRM data in seconds. Copilot generates first drafts of PRDs, status updates, and launch plans that are 80% ready, saving hours of writing time each week. Weekly digests automatically summarize decisions, insights, and open threads.\n\n**The PM's experience changes from**: \"I need to pull data from 5 tools and write this update\" **to**: \"Copilot drafted my update - let me review and add my perspective.\"\n\n### Year 2 (2027): The Strategic Partner\n\nCopilot proactively surfaces insights before the PM asks. It detects that a key metric is trending down, correlates it with a recent feature change, and drafts a hypothesis with suggested next steps. It identifies patterns across the product portfolio - features that consistently miss deadlines, customer segments that are underserved, roadmap commitments that conflict with capacity. It becomes the PM's analytical backbone.\n\n**The PM's experience changes from**: \"I noticed something in the data\" **to**: \"Copilot flagged an opportunity I hadn't seen and suggested three ways to investigate.\"\n\n### Year 3 (2029): The Product Intelligence Platform\n\nCopilot becomes the connective tissue of the entire product organization. It creates a shared memory across PMs, designers, and engineers. When a new PM joins the team, Copilot provides full context on every product decision, the reasoning behind it, and the outcomes. Product leaders see real-time portfolio health dashboards powered by AI synthesis, not manual reporting. The entire product development lifecycle is augmented by intelligence.\n\n**The PM's experience changes from**: \"I need to get up to speed on this product area\" **to**: \"Copilot has full context on every decision and can brief me in minutes.\"\n\n---\n\n## Who We Serve\n\n### Primary: The Overwhelmed PM\n\nMid-career product managers at growing SaaS companies (50-500 employees) who are managing multiple features or products. They are smart and capable, but drowning in operational overhead. They stay late writing status updates instead of talking to customers. Copilot gives them their strategic time back.\n\n### Secondary: The Product Leader\n\nDirectors and VPs of Product who need portfolio-level visibility without asking every PM for an update. They want to know where risk is, what decisions are being made, and whether the team is focused on the right things. Copilot provides this layer of intelligence automatically.\n\n### Tertiary: The Cross-Functional Partner\n\nEngineers, designers, and business stakeholders who consume PM artifacts. They want clearer communication, faster answers, and better alignment. Copilot improves the quality and consistency of everything the PM produces.\n\n---\n\n## Strategic Principles\n\nThese principles guide every product decision we make:\n\n1. **Augment, never replace**: Copilot makes PMs more effective. It does not make product decisions. The PM is always in control, and Copilot is always transparent about its reasoning.\n\n2. **Context is everything**: The more Copilot knows about the PM's product, team, and company, the more valuable it becomes. We invest heavily in integrations and contextual understanding.\n\n3. **Start with time saved, end with insights gained**: The entry point is saving time on routine tasks. The long-term value is surfacing insights humans would miss. We earn the right to provide intelligence by first proving reliability on basics.\n\n4. **Build for the workflow, not the feature**: We do not build isolated AI features. Every capability fits into how PMs actually work, day by day, meeting by meeting.\n\n5. **Earn trust through accuracy**: One wrong answer erodes trust more than ten right answers build it. We prioritize accuracy and transparency over speed and coverage.\n\n---\n\n## What Success Looks Like\n\nIn three years, we will know this vision is realized when:\n\n- **500,000 PMs** use Copilot as part of their daily workflow\n- PMs using Copilot report spending **50%+ of their time on strategic work** (up from 28%)\n- Copilot is cited as a **top-3 tool** in annual PM tooling surveys\n- Product organizations using Copilot show measurably **faster time-to-decision** and **higher team alignment scores**\n- We have built a defensible data moat through **product management-specific AI models** trained on anonymized, aggregated workflow patterns\n\n---\n\n## Call to Action\n\nThis vision is ambitious but achievable. The AI capabilities exist today. The market need is urgent and validated. The team has the talent and conviction to execute.\n\nWhat we need is focus and commitment. We need to resist the temptation to build for everyone and instead go deep on the product management use case. We need to invest in integrations that build contextual understanding. And we need to move fast, because the window for establishing category leadership is measured in months, not years.\n\nThe future of product management is intelligent, augmented, and strategic. We are going to build it.",
  "system_prompt": "You are an expert product leader crafting an inspiring product vision document. The purpose of a product vision is to paint a vivid picture of the future you are building toward, align the entire organization around a shared direction, and provide a north star that guides decisions for the next 2-5 years. A great vision document makes people feel both the urgency of the problem and the excitement of the future state.\n\nStructure the vision document with the following sections:\n\n1. **Header**: Product name, author, date, and time horizon (typically 2-5 years).\n\n2. **Vision Statement**: A single bold sentence or short paragraph that captures the essence of what you are building and why it matters. This should be memorable, specific enough to guide decisions, and inspiring enough to motivate the team. Avoid generic statements like \"build the best product\" - instead describe the specific transformation you want to create in the world.\n\n3. **The World Today**: Describe the current state of the world and the pain it causes. Use specific data, research findings, and real user experiences. Make the reader feel the problem viscerally. This section builds the case for why change is needed.\n\n4. **The World We Are Building**: Describe the future state in concrete, vivid terms. Break this into time horizons (Year 1, Year 2, Year 3) to make it tangible and show progression. For each horizon, describe what the user experience looks like - not features, but transformations. Use \"before and after\" contrasts to make the change tangible.\n\n5. **Who We Serve**: Define your target users with empathy and specificity. Create brief persona sketches that capture the person, their context, and their unmet needs. Cover primary, secondary, and tertiary audiences.\n\n6. **Strategic Principles**: Define 3-5 principles that guide product decisions. These should be opinionated and specific to your product. A good principle helps the team make decisions when you are not in the room. Each principle should have a brief explanation of what it means in practice.\n\n7. **What Success Looks Like**: Define the measurable outcomes that indicate the vision is being realized. Include both quantitative metrics and qualitative signals. Think big but be specific.\n\n8. **Call to Action**: End with a motivating paragraph that rallies the team. Acknowledge the challenge, express confidence, and make clear what is needed to succeed.\n\nTone guidelines:\n- Be ambitious and inspiring, but grounded in reality. Vision without execution is hallucination.\n- Write with conviction. A vision document is not the place for hedging or presenting alternatives.\n- Use vivid, concrete language. Replace abstractions with specific scenarios and examples.\n- Balance emotion with evidence. Support bold claims with data points.\n- Write for a broad audience. Engineering, design, sales, and leadership should all find this compelling.\n- Avoid buzzwords and jargon. If a sentence sounds like it could apply to any product, rewrite it.",
