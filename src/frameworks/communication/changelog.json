No more spending Monday mornings manually piecing together what happened last week.\n\n**What's included in your digest:**\n- Decisions and conclusions from your queries and documents\n- Key data trends and anomalies you explored\n- PRDs, briefs, and updates you created or edited\n- Unresolved questions and incomplete analyses\n- AI-recommended priorities for the coming week\n\nDigests arrive via email and in-app notification at 8:00 AM your local time. You can edit, annotate, and share them directly from the app, or send a formatted version to Slack with one click.\n\n[Learn more about Smart Digest ->]\n\n---\n\n### Improved Query Accuracy for Metrics Questions\n\nWe have significantly improved how Copilot handles quantitative queries. Questions like \"What was our MRR growth rate last quarter?\" and \"Show me churn by customer segment\" now return more accurate and complete results.\n\n**What changed:**\n- Upgraded our data retrieval pipeline to handle multi-step calculations (growth rates, ratios, period-over-period comparisons)\n- Added automatic confidence scoring - Copilot now tells you how confident it is in numerical answers and flags when data might be incomplete\n- Improved handling of ambiguous time ranges (\"last quarter\" now correctly resolves based on your company's fiscal calendar)\n\n**By the numbers:** Query accuracy for metrics-related questions improved from 79% to 94% in our benchmark tests.\n\n---\n\n### Notion Integration (Beta)\n\nCopilot now connects to your Notion workspace. Pull context from your Notion pages and databases directly into Copilot queries, and export generated artifacts back to Notion with formatting preserved.\n\n**Supported capabilities:**\n- Search and reference Notion pages in your queries (\"Summarize the Q1 roadmap from Notion\")\n- Export PRDs, briefs, and status updates to a Notion page with one click\n- Sync Notion databases as data sources for analytics queries\n\nThis integration is in beta. Connect your Notion workspace in Settings > Integrations to try it out. We would love your feedback.\n\n[Connect Notion ->]\n\n---\n\n### Faster Response Times\n\nNobody likes waiting. We have optimized our AI pipeline to deliver faster responses across the board.\n\n| Query Type | Before | After | Improvement |\n|------------|--------|-------|-------------|\n| Simple questions | 2.1s | 0.8s | 62% faster |\n| Data queries | 4.5s | 1.6s | 64% faster |\n| Document generation | 8.2s | 3.4s | 59% faster |\n\nThese improvements come from a new response caching layer and optimized embedding computations. Complex multi-step queries will continue to improve in upcoming releases.\n\n---\n\n### Bug Fixes and Improvements\n\n- **Fixed**: Exported PDFs no longer cut off table columns on narrow page widths\n- **Fixed**: Slack notifications were sometimes delivered twice for the same event\n- **Fixed**: The \"Copy to clipboard\" button now correctly copies markdown formatting in Safari\n- **Improved**: Date picker in the analytics dashboard now supports keyboard navigation\n- **Improved**: Search results in the query history panel now highlight matching terms\n- **Improved**: Error messages when an integration connection expires are now more descriptive and include a direct link to reconnect\n\n---\n\n## v2.3.2 - January 14, 2026\n\n### Patch: Critical Fix for Jira Sync\n\nWe identified and resolved an issue where Jira ticket syncs were failing for projects with more than 500 open issues. The sync would time out silently, leaving Copilot with stale data. This patch increases the sync timeout and adds paginated fetching.\n\nIf your Jira integration has been showing outdated data, please trigger a manual re-sync from Settings > Integrations > Jira > Re-sync.\n\n---\n\n## v2.3.0 - January 7, 2026\n\n### Template Library: 15 New PM Templates\n\nWe have added 15 new templates to help you get started faster with common PM artifacts. New templates include:\n\n- Competitive analysis matrix\n- Customer interview guide\n- Feature prioritization scorecard (RICE)\n- Sprint retrospective summary\n- Quarterly business review deck outline\n\nAll templates are customizable. Edit them to match your team's conventions and save as custom templates.\n\n[Browse templates ->]\n\n---\n\n### Multi-Language Support (6 New Languages)\n\nCopilot now supports queries and document generation in 8 languages total. New additions: German, French, Spanish, Portuguese, Japanese, and Korean. Copilot detects your query language automatically and responds in kind. You can also set a default language in Settings > Preferences.\n\n---\n\n### Team Workspace Improvements\n\n- **Shared query history**: Team members can now browse and re-run queries from teammates (with permission controls)\n- **Workspace-level templates**: Admins can publish templates that appear for all workspace members\n- **Activity feed**: A new feed in the workspace dashboard shows recent team activity, helping leaders stay informed without asking for updates",
  "system_prompt": "You are an expert product communicator writing a user-facing changelog. The changelog serves two purposes: it informs users about what changed, and it builds excitement and trust in the product. Every entry should make users feel that the product is actively improving and that their feedback is being heard.\n\nStructure the changelog with the following conventions:\n\n1. **Version Header**: Each release gets a version number and date. Use semantic versioning (major.minor.patch). Group changes under the version they shipped in.\n\n2. **Feature Entries (New and Improved)**: Each significant feature or improvement gets its own section with a descriptive heading. Structure each entry as:\n   - **Headline**: A short, benefit-oriented title (not a technical description). \"Smart Digest: Your AI-Generated Weekly Summary\" is better than \"Added digest generation feature.\"\n   - **Context**: 1-2 sentences explaining why this matters to the user. Connect it to a problem they experience.\n   - **Details**: A clear description of what the feature does, using bullet points for multiple capabilities. Focus on what the user can now do, not how it works technically.\n   - **Call to action**: Where applicable, include a link or instruction to try the feature.\n\n3. **Performance Improvements**: When communicating speed or reliability improvements, use before/after comparisons with specific numbers. A table format works well. Users appreciate knowing the magnitude of improvement.\n\n4. **Bug Fixes and Minor Improvements**: Group these at the bottom of each version under a single heading. Use a bulleted list with brief one-line descriptions. Prefix each with \"Fixed:\" or \"Improved:\" for scannability. Only include bugs that users would have noticed.\n\n5. **Patch Releases**: For hotfix or patch releases, keep the entry brief. Explain what broke, what was affected, and what users need to do (if anything).\n\nTone guidelines:\n- Write for users, not engineers. Avoid technical jargon, internal code names, and implementation details.\n- Be enthusiastic but genuine. Celebrate real improvements without overselling.\n- Be specific. \"62% faster response times\" is better than \"performance improvements.\"\n- Acknowledge problems honestly. When fixing bugs, briefly explain what went wrong without being defensive.\n- Use second person (\"you\", \"your\") to make it personal.\n- Keep entries concise. Users scan changelogs. Lead with the most important information.\n- Order entries within each version by impact: biggest features first, bug fixes last.\n- Include enough historical entries to show momentum. 2-3 recent versions is ideal.",
