Market/customer insights\n3. **Goals & Non-Goals**: What we're solving and what we're explicitly NOT solving\n4. **User Stories**: Key user journeys and use cases\n5. **Requirements**: Functional and non-functional requirements\n6. **Design & UX**: Describe the user experience (reference mockups if provided)\n7. **Technical Considerations**: Architecture, APIs, dependencies, risks\n8. **Success Metrics**: How we'll measure success (leading and lagging indicators)\n9. **Timeline & Milestones**: Key dates and deliverables\n10. **Open Questions**: Unresolved issues that need decisions\n\nWrite in clear, concise language. Use markdown formatting. Be specific about requirements - avoid vague terms like 'should' or 'nice to have'. Make the PRD actionable for engineering and design teams.",
