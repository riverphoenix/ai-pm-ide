  "example_output": "# Porter's Five Forces Analysis: PM IDE\n\n## 🏭 Industry Overview\n**Industry**: AI-Powered Product Management Tools\n**Market Stage**: Early growth (emerging category)\n**Analysis Date**: Q1 2026\n\n---\n\n## 1. 🤼 Threat of New Entrants — MODERATE-HIGH\n\n**Overall Assessment**: The barrier to entry is moderate. While building a basic AI wrapper is easy, creating a deep PM-specific tool requires domain expertise.\n\n### Barriers to Entry\n- **Low**: Access to LLM APIs (OpenAI, Anthropic) is commoditized\n- **Low**: Open-source frameworks (Tauri, React) reduce dev costs\n- **Medium**: PM domain expertise needed for quality framework templates\n- **High**: Building a curated library of 45+ frameworks takes significant effort\n- **High**: Achieving AI output quality that PMs trust requires extensive tuning\n\n### Key Factors\n- **Capital Requirements**: Low ($50K-$200K to build MVP)\n- **Switching Costs**: Low for users (data export is easy)\n- **Brand Loyalty**: Not yet established in this nascent category\n- **Regulatory Barriers**: Minimal (data privacy compliance is standard)\n\n### Implications\n- Fast-follow competitors can emerge within 3-6 months\n- First-mover advantage is limited; execution speed matters more\n- Need to build network effects (community, shared templates) quickly\n\n---\n\n## 2. 💪 Bargaining Power of Suppliers — HIGH\n\n**Overall Assessment**: LLM providers hold significant power as the core technology dependency.\n\n### Key Suppliers\n- **LLM Providers (OpenAI, Anthropic, Google)**: Critical dependency\n  - Few alternatives for high-quality language models\n  - API pricing changes directly impact unit economics\n  - Rate limits can constrain product experience\n- **Cloud Infrastructure (AWS, GCP)**: Moderate power\n  - Commoditized; easy to switch providers\n  - Costs are predictable and manageable\n- **Open-Source Community**: Low power\n  - Tauri, React, and other frameworks are freely available\n  - Large contributor base ensures continuity\n\n### Risk Factors\n- OpenAI/Anthropic could raise prices 2-3x with limited alternatives\n- API deprecation could break core features overnight\n- Exclusive deals between LLM providers and competitors possible\n\n### Mitigation Strategies\n- Multi-model support (Claude, GPT, Gemini, Llama)\n- Local model fallback (Ollama integration)\n- Caching and prompt optimization to reduce API dependency\n\n---\n\n## 3. 💰 Bargaining Power of Buyers — MODERATE\n\n**Overall Assessment**: Individual PMs have moderate power; enterprise buyers have high power.\n\n### Buyer Segments\n- **Individual PMs**: Price-sensitive, many free alternatives (ChatGPT, Notion AI)\n  - Low switching costs between tools\n  - High price elasticity at $20/month tier\n  - Value convenience and time savings over brand\n- **Enterprise Teams**: Budget-conscious but willing to pay for quality\n  - Require security, compliance, and admin features\n  - Longer procurement cycles but higher LTV\n  - More likely to negotiate on price\n\n### Factors Increasing Buyer Power\n- Abundant free AI tools (ChatGPT, Claude.ai) serve basic needs\n- PMs are sophisticated buyers who evaluate tools carefully\n- Low switching costs; data portability expected\n\n### Factors Decreasing Buyer Power\n- No direct competitor offers PM-specific AI framework generation\n- Context persistence across sessions creates stickiness\n- Time savings of 5-10 hours/week justifies $20/month easily\n\n---\n\n## 4. 🔄 Threat of Substitutes — HIGH\n\n**Overall Assessment**: Many alternatives can partially fulfill the same need, making substitution threat significant.\n\n### Direct Substitutes\n| Substitute | Overlap | Weakness vs PM IDE |\n|---|---|---|\n| ChatGPT / Claude.ai | General AI chat | No PM-specific frameworks, no context persistence |\n| Notion AI | Doc generation | Generic, not PM-workflow optimized |\n| Miro AI | Visual frameworks | Limited text analysis, no deep AI generation |\n| Gamma.app | Presentations | Presentation-focused, not strategy work |\n\n### Indirect Substitutes\n- **Manual methods**: Spreadsheets, whiteboards, templates\n- **Consultants**: External strategy consultants ($200-500/hour)\n- **PM education platforms**: Reforge, Maven (learn, then DIY)\n\n### Substitute Advantages\n- Free or already paid for (bundled with existing tools)\n- Familiar interfaces (no learning curve)\n- Broader use cases (not PM-specific)\n\n### Differentiation Strategy\n- Deep PM domain expertise baked into prompts\n- Integrated workflow (research to strategy to roadmap)\n- Context persistence across all frameworks and sessions\n\n---\n\n## 5. ⚔️ Competitive Rivalry — LOW-MODERATE\n\n**Overall Assessment**: Direct competition is currently low, but adjacent competitors are numerous.\n\n### Direct Competitors\n- **Few dedicated AI PM tools exist today**\n- Most competitors are general-purpose AI or productivity tools\n- Category is nascent; no clear market leader yet\n\n### Adjacent Competitors\n- **Notion**: Moving toward AI-powered PM workflows\n- **Confluence + Atlassian Intelligence**: Enterprise PM documentation\n- **Productboard**: Feature prioritization with emerging AI\n- **Dovetail**: Research-focused AI tool expanding scope\n\n### Rivalry Intensity Factors\n- **Market Growth**: High growth reduces rivalry (expanding pie)\n- **Differentiation**: PM IDE is highly differentiated today\n- **Exit Barriers**: Low (SaaS can pivot or shut down easily)\n- **Concentration**: Fragmented market with no dominant player\n\n---\n\n## 📊 Five Forces Summary\n\n| Force | Intensity | Trend | Priority |\n|---|---|---|---|\n| Threat of New Entrants | Moderate-High | ↑ Increasing | Build moats fast |\n| Supplier Power | High | → Stable | Diversify LLM providers |\n| Buyer Power | Moderate | ↑ Increasing | Increase switching costs |\n| Threat of Substitutes | High | ↑ Increasing | Deepen differentiation |\n| Competitive Rivalry | Low-Moderate | ↑ Increasing | Move fast, own category |\n\n## 🎯 Strategic Recommendations\n\n### Immediate Actions (0-3 months)\n1. **Reduce supplier power**: Integrate 3+ LLM providers and add local model support\n2. **Increase switching costs**: Build data network effects (shared templates, team context)\n3. **Differentiate from substitutes**: Launch 20+ PM-specific features ChatGPT cannot replicate\n\n### Medium-Term (3-12 months)\n1. **Raise barriers to entry**: Build community marketplace for frameworks\n2. **Reduce buyer power**: Create enterprise features (SSO, audit logs, admin controls)\n3. **Pre-empt rivalry**: Establish category leadership through content marketing and partnerships\n\n### Long-Term (12+ months)\n1. **Platform play**: Become the operating system for PM workflows\n2. **Ecosystem lock-in**: Integrations with Jira, Slack, Figma create multi-product stickiness\n3. **Data moat**: Aggregated PM insights across customers create unique value",
