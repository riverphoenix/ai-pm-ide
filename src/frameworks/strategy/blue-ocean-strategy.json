Nobody is competing on **AI-native strategic thinking for product managers**.\n\n---\n\n## 🔵 Blue Ocean: The Four Actions Framework (ERRC Grid)\n\n### ❌ ELIMINATE\n*Which factors that the industry takes for granted should be eliminated?*\n\n1. **General-purpose document editing**\n   - Why: PMs do not need another Google Docs or Notion. They need strategic output, not blank canvases.\n   - Impact: Reduces complexity, sharpens positioning\n   - Savings: 40% less development surface area\n\n2. **Real-time collaborative editing (in MVP)**\n   - Why: Multi-cursor collaboration is table stakes for generic tools but not critical for individual strategic thinking work. PMs do deep work alone, then share.\n   - Impact: Dramatically simplifies architecture, faster time to market\n   - Savings: 6+ months of engineering effort\n\n3. **Complex permission and admin systems (in MVP)**\n   - Why: Individual PMs and small teams do not need enterprise admin. Add later.\n   - Impact: Faster onboarding, simpler UX\n\n---\n\n### ⬇️ REDUCE\n*Which factors should be reduced well below the industry standard?*\n\n1. **Template customization complexity**\n   - Industry standard: Drag-and-drop template builders with dozens of options\n   - Our approach: Curated, expert-designed templates that work out of the box\n   - Reduction: 80% fewer customization options, but 10x better default quality\n\n2. **Integration breadth**\n   - Industry standard: 100+ integrations\n   - Our approach: 5 essential integrations (Jira, Slack, Notion, Confluence, Linear)\n   - Reduction: Fewer integrations, but deeper and more useful ones\n\n3. **Learning curve**\n   - Industry standard: 30-60 minute onboarding tutorials\n   - Our approach: Generate first framework within 2 minutes of signup\n   - Reduction: Near-zero learning curve through guided AI conversation\n\n---\n\n### ⬆️ RAISE\n*Which factors should be raised well above the industry standard?*\n\n1. **PM domain expertise in AI output**\n   - Industry standard: Generic AI that produces surface-level content\n   - Our standard: Expert PM-level strategic frameworks with nuanced analysis\n   - How: 45+ PM-specific system prompts crafted by experienced product leaders\n   - Magnitude: From \"decent first draft\" to \"presentation-ready strategic document\"\n\n2. **Output quality and professionalism**\n   - Industry standard: Raw text that needs extensive formatting and editing\n   - Our standard: Publication-ready markdown with proper structure, tables, and visual hierarchy\n   - How: Framework-specific formatting rules and quality checks\n\n3. **Speed of strategic work**\n   - Industry standard: 4-8 hours for a competitive analysis\n   - Our standard: 5-10 minutes for a complete, nuanced analysis\n   - How: AI generation with persistent context eliminates repetitive work\n   - Magnitude: 50x speed improvement\n\n---\n\n### ✨ CREATE\n*Which factors should be created that the industry has never offered?*\n\n1. **Persistent Product Context Memory**\n   - What: AI remembers everything about your product, market, competitors, and prior analyses\n   - Why it is new: No tool maintains PM-specific context across sessions and frameworks\n   - Value: Eliminates the \"start from scratch\" problem every single time\n   - Example: Your competitive analysis automatically references insights from your SWOT done 3 weeks ago\n\n2. **AI Framework Advisor**\n   - What: AI recommends which PM framework to use based on your current situation\n   - Why it is new: Tools provide templates but never guidance on when to use them\n   - Value: Junior PMs gain the judgment of senior PMs; senior PMs discover new frameworks\n   - Example: \"You are entering a new market. Consider running Porter's Five Forces and a Blue Ocean analysis.\"\n\n3. **Strategic Evolution Tracking**\n   - What: Automatic tracking of how your strategy changes over time across all frameworks\n   - Why it is new: Documents are static snapshots; this makes strategy a living, evolving artifact\n   - Value: See the trajectory of strategic decisions, identify patterns, and learn from pivots\n\n4. **Framework Chaining**\n   - What: Connect multiple frameworks into a strategic workflow (e.g., SWOT -> Porter's -> Strategy Canvas)\n   - Why it is new: Frameworks exist in isolation everywhere else\n   - Value: Compound insights across frameworks for deeper, more connected strategic thinking\n\n---\n\n## 📊 Strategy Canvas\n\n### Value Curve Comparison\n\n```\nHigh │                                          ★ PM IDE\n     │                              ★           ★\n     │         ●                    ★     ●     ★\n     │    ●    ●    ●         ●     ★     ●\n     │    ●    ●    ●    ●    ●     ●\n     │    ●    ●    ●    ●    ●\n     │              ●    ●\n     │                   ●\nLow  │\n     └─────┬────┬────┬────┬────┬────┬────┬────┬────\n          Doc  Collab Tmpl Integ Ent  PM   Context Speed\n          Edit       Var  Count Feat Expert Memory\n\n● = Industry Average (Notion, Confluence, Miro)\n★ = PM IDE\n```\n\n| Factor | Industry Avg | PM IDE | Delta |\n|---|---|---|---|\n| Document editing | 8/10 | 3/10 | ⬇️ Eliminated as focus |\n| Team collaboration | 9/10 | 4/10 | ⬇️ Reduced (MVP) |\n| Template variety | 7/10 | 6/10 | ⬇️ Slightly reduced |\n| Integration count | 8/10 | 4/10 | ⬇️ Reduced, deeper |\n| Enterprise features | 7/10 | 3/10 | ⬇️ Eliminated (MVP) |\n| PM domain expertise | 3/10 | 10/10 | ⬆️ Raised significantly |\n| Context memory | 1/10 | 10/10 | ✨ Created |\n| Speed of output | 2/10 | 10/10 | ⬆️ Raised significantly |\n| Framework advising | 0/10 | 8/10 | ✨ Created |\n| Strategy tracking | 0/10 | 7/10 | ✨ Created |\n\n---\n\n## 🎯 Blue Ocean Definition\n\n### Our Blue Ocean\n**\"AI-Native Strategic Thinking for Product Managers\"**\n\nThis is an entirely new market space that does not exist today. It is defined by:\n- Deep PM domain expertise embedded in AI generation\n- Persistent context that compounds value over time\n- Framework intelligence (knowing what to use, when, and how to connect them)\n- Speed that transforms strategic work from a multi-day effort to a multi-minute one\n\n### Non-Customers We Can Convert\n\n| Non-Customer Type | Who They Are | Why They Do Not Use PM Tools Today | How We Convert Them |\n|---|---|---|---|\n| First-tier | PMs who use ChatGPT for strategy work | Existing PM tools are too complex and slow | Offer PM-specific AI that is faster and smarter |\n| Second-tier | Founders doing their own PM work | Cannot justify time for formal PM processes | Make strategic frameworks effortless (5 min) |\n| Third-tier | Engineering managers making product decisions | PM tools feel foreign and unnecessary | Show that strategic thinking does not require PM training |\n\n---\n\n## 📋 Implementation Roadmap\n\n### Phase 1: Create the Blue Ocean (Months 1-3)\n- Launch with core ERRC factors: PM expertise, context memory, speed\n- Target early adopters: Solo PMs at startups who already use ChatGPT\n- Message: \"Stop using ChatGPT for PM work. Use a tool that actually thinks like a PM.\"\n\n### Phase 2: Widen the Gap (Months 4-8)\n- Add Framework Advisor and Strategy Tracking (created factors)\n- Build community marketplace for user-contributed frameworks\n- Expand to second-tier non-customers (founders)\n\n### Phase 3: Defend the Blue Ocean (Months 9-18)\n- Develop data moat from aggregated PM patterns\n- Add team features (selectively; avoid red ocean of collaboration tools)\n- Establish category leadership through education and content\n\n### Blue Ocean Traps to Avoid\n1. **Do not get pulled back into the red ocean** by adding generic editing and collaboration features just because competitors have them\n2. **Do not over-engineer** enterprise features before validating with individual PMs\n3. **Do not compete on price**; compete on value and time saved\n4. **Do not spread thin** across all PM workflows; go deep on strategic frameworks first",
  "system_prompt": "You are a strategic innovation expert specializing in Blue Ocean Strategy, the framework created by W. Chan Kim and Renee Mauborgne for creating uncontested market space.\n\nBased on the provided context, create a detailed Blue Ocean Strategy analysis that helps identify how to make competition irrelevant by creating new market space.\n\n## Structure:\n\n### 1.
