AI framework generation (SWOT, PRD, competitive analysis, etc.)\n2. Persistent project context across all frameworks\n3. Multi-LLM support (Claude, GPT, Gemini)\n4. Local-first data storage for privacy\n5. Export to Markdown, PDF, Notion\n\n---\n\n## 5. 📢 Channels\n\n**Path to customers:**\n\n### Free / Organic\n- Product Hunt launch (target: Top 5 of the Day)\n- PM community engagement (Lenny's Slack, Mind the Product)\n- SEO content: \"Best PM frameworks\" guides\n- Twitter/LinkedIn thought leadership\n\n### Paid\n- Sponsored newsletters (Lenny's Newsletter: $5K per issue, 500K readers)\n- YouTube PM creator partnerships\n- Google Ads on PM-related keywords ($3-5 CPC)\n\n### Partnership\n- Reforge and Maven course integrations\n- PM bootcamp curriculum partnerships\n- Atlassian marketplace listing\n\n---\n\n## 6. 💰 Revenue Streams\n\n| Tier | Price | Features | Target |\n|---|---|---|---|\n| Free | $0/month | 5 frameworks/month, 1 project | Individual PMs (acquisition) |\n| Pro | $20/month | Unlimited frameworks, 10 projects, all LLMs | Power users |\n| Team | $15/user/month | Shared context, team templates, admin controls | PM teams (5-20) |\n| Enterprise | Custom | SSO, audit logs, dedicated support, SLA | Large orgs (50+) |\n\n**Revenue Target**: $100K ARR by month 12\n\n---\n\n## 7. 📊 Key Metrics\n\n**Pirate Metrics (AARRR):**\n\n| Stage | Metric | Target (Month 6) |\n|---|---|---|\n| **Acquisition** | Monthly signups | 2,000 |\n| **Activation** | Complete first framework within 24h | 60% |\n| **Retention** | Weekly active users (WAU) | 40% of signups |\n| **Revenue** | Free-to-paid conversion | 8% |\n| **Referral** | Users who invite a colleague | 15% |\n\n### North Star Metric\n**Frameworks generated per user per week** (target: 3+)\n- Indicates real value delivery\n- Correlates with retention and willingness to pay\n\n---\n\n## 8. 💵 Cost Structure\n\n**Monthly costs at 1,000 users:**\n\n| Category | Cost | Type |\n|---|---|---|\n| LLM API costs | $3,000/month | Variable ($3/active user) |\n| Cloud hosting | $200/month | Fixed (minimal; local-first) |\n| Engineering (2 FTE) | $30,000/month | Fixed |\n| Marketing | $2,000/month | Variable |\n| Tools & services | $500/month | Fixed |\n| **Total** | **$35,700/month** | |\n\n### Break-Even Analysis\n- Need 1,785 paid users at $20/month to cover costs\n- With 8% conversion: need ~22,000 free signups\n- Timeline estimate: Month 14-18\n\n---\n\n## 9. 🏰 Unfair Advantage\n\n**What cannot be easily copied or bought:**\n\n1. **PM-Specific AI Training Data**\n   - Curated prompt library fine-tuned for PM workflows over 12+ months\n   - Quality of output improves with each iteration (flywheel)\n\n2. **Contextual Knowledge Graph**\n   - The more a user uses PM IDE, the smarter it gets about their product\n   - Competitors start from zero context every time\n\n3. **Community & Templates Marketplace**\n   - User-contributed framework templates create network effects\n   - Hard to bootstrap; first-mover advantage matters\n\n4. **Domain Expertise**\n   - Founded by experienced PMs who deeply understand the workflow\n   - Generic AI tools lack this specialized knowledge\n\n---\n\n## 📋 Canvas Summary\n\n```\n┌──────────────┬──────────────┬──────────────┬──────────────┬──────────────┐\n│   PROBLEM    │   SOLUTION   │    UVP       │   UNFAIR     │  CUSTOMER    │\n│              │              │              │  ADVANTAGE   │  SEGMENTS    │\n│ • Tool sprawl│ • AI framewk │ \"AI copilot  │              │              │\n│ • Time waste │   generation │  that thinks │ • PM-trained │ • Solo PMs   │\n│ • Inconsist- │ • Persistent │  like a PM\"  │   AI models  │   at startups│\n│   ent quality│   context    │              │ • Context    │ • PM teams   │\n│              │ • Multi-LLM  │              │   graph      │   at mid-mkt │\n├──────────────┼──────────────┤              │ • Community  │              │\n│  EXISTING    │ KEY METRICS  │              │   templates  │              │\n│ ALTERNATIVES │              │              │              │              │\n│ • ChatGPT   │ • 3+ framwks │              │              │              │\n│ • Notion    │   per user/wk│              │              │              │\n│ • Consulting│ • 60% activ. │              │              │              │\n│ • PM courses│ • 8% convert │              │              │              │\n├──────────────┴──────────────┼──────────────┼──────────────┴──────────────┤\n│       COST STRUCTURE        │   CHANNELS   │      REVENUE STREAMS       │\n│                             │              │                            │\n│ • LLM APIs: $3K/mo         │ • ProductHunt│ • Free: $0 (acquisition)   │\n│ • Engineering: $30K/mo      │ • PM Slack   │ • Pro: $20/user/mo         │\n│ • Marketing: $2K/mo         │ • Newsletters│ • Team: $15/user/mo        │\n│ • Hosting: $200/mo          │ • SEO content│ • Enterprise: Custom       │\n└─────────────────────────────┴──────────────┴────────────────────────────┘\n```",
  "system_prompt": "You are a startup strategy expert specializing in Lean Canvas, the one-page business model framework adapted by Ash Maurya from the Business Model Canvas.\n\nBased on the provided context, create a complete Lean Canvas covering all 9 blocks. The Lean Canvas is specifically designed for startups and emphasizes problems, solutions, key metrics, and unfair advantages.\n\n## Structure:\n\nAnalyze each block in this specific order (the Lean Canvas order, not Business Model Canvas order):\n\n### 1. Problem (Top 3 problems)\n- List the top 3 problems your target customers face\n- For each problem, describe the pain point in specific, measurable terms\n- List existing alternatives customers currently use to solve these problems\n- Be specific: quantify the pain (hours wasted, dollars lost, frustration level)\n\n### 2. Customer Segments\n- Define your early adopter profile precisely (demographics, psychographics, behaviors)\n- Distinguish between early adopters and mainstream customers\n- Estimate market size for each segment\n- Describe what makes early adopters different and why they will adopt first\n\n### 3. Unique Value Proposition\n- Craft a single clear compelling message that states why you are different and worth attention\n- Create a high-level concept (X for Y analogy, e.g., \"YouTube for cooking\")\n- Focus on the end benefit, not features\n- Make it specific, not generic\n\n### 4. Solution\n- Map each solution directly to one of the top 3 problems\n- Use a table format showing Problem -> Solution -> Feature\n- List the MVP features needed (keep it minimal)\n- Focus on the simplest thing that could work\n\n### 5. Channels\n- Identify free/organic, paid, and partnership channels\n- Be specific about each channel with estimated costs and reach\n- Prioritize channels that reach early adopters specifically\n\n### 6. Revenue Streams\n- Define pricing tiers with specific prices and features\n- Include a revenue target with timeline\n- Consider freemium, subscription, usage-based, or one-time models\n\n### 7. Key Metrics\n- Use the AARRR pirate metrics framework (Acquisition, Activation, Retention, Revenue, Referral)\n- Set specific numeric targets for each metric\n- Identify the single North Star Metric that best represents value delivery\n\n### 8. Cost Structure\n- Break down fixed and variable costs with actual dollar amounts\n- Calculate break-even point\n- Include a timeline to profitability estimate\n\n### 9. Unfair Advantage\n- List things that cannot be easily copied or bought\n- Be honest: if there is no clear unfair advantage yet, say so and suggest how to build one\n- Consider: insider knowledge, community, existing audience, team expertise, network effects\n\n## Final Summary:\nInclude an ASCII art visual summary of the full Lean Canvas in the traditional layout.\n\n## Guidelines:\n- Be concise and specific, not generic\n- Use tables for comparisons and structured data\n- Include actual numbers, estimates, and metrics\n- Keep language startup-oriented (iteration, MVP, early adopters)\n- Use emoji icons for each section for visual clarity",
