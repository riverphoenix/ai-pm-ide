We occupy the upper-right quadrant that no competitor currently owns.\n\n---\n\n## Competitive Advantages & Vulnerabilities\n\n### Our Advantages\n1. **Only PM-specific AI tool with persistent context** -- no competitor offers a knowledge layer that improves over time\n2. **Local-first architecture** -- addresses the #1 concern PMs have about AI tools (data privacy)\n3. **Framework depth** -- 45+ frameworks vs. generic templates, with expert-level system prompts for each\n4. **Speed to value** -- generate first useful output in under 5 minutes vs. weeks for enterprise tools\n\n### Our Vulnerabilities\n1. **No collaboration features** -- Productboard, Notion, and Craft.io all support team workflows\n2. **No integrations** -- competing tools connect to Jira, Salesforce, Slack, etc.\n3. **Single-player tool** -- in a market moving toward team-based workflows\n4. **Brand awareness** -- zero brand recognition vs. established players with millions of users\n\n---\n\n## Key Insights & Strategic Recommendations\n\n1. **The market gap is real**: No existing tool combines PM-specific AI intelligence with persistent product context. This is our defensible position.\n\n2. **Build moat before competing on features**: Collaboration and integrations are table stakes, not differentiators. Our moat is the context layer and framework depth. Invest here first.\n\n3. **Position against ChatGPT, not Productboard**: Our most common competitor is a PM using ChatGPT with custom prompts. Win this comparison and the market opens up.\n\n4. **Local-first is a wedge**: Data privacy concerns are universal among PMs. This is our Trojan horse into enterprise accounts where Notion and ChatGPT are blocked.\n\n5. **Speed is the killer feature**: Time to first value (< 5 min) is 100x faster than Productboard (weeks). Lead with this in all messaging.\n\n6. **Collaboration is the #1 risk**: If we remain single-player for more than 6 months post-launch, we risk being boxed into a niche. Plan team features for v2.",
  "system_prompt": "You are a competitive intelligence analyst and product strategist with expertise in market analysis, Porter's Five Forces, and strategic positioning.\n\nUsing the provided context, create a thorough competitive analysis that helps the product team understand the competitive landscape, identify market gaps, and inform strategic positioning decisions.\n\n## Structure your analysis with these sections:\n\n1. **Market Overview**: Define the market being analyzed -- market size (if known or estimable), growth drivers, market stage (nascent, growth, mature), and key trends shaping the landscape. Keep this to one concise paragraph plus 3-4 bullet points.\n\n2. **Our Product Positioning**: Briefly state what the product is, who it serves, and its 3-4 key differentiators. This anchors the comparison.\n\n3. **Competitor Profiles**: For each major competitor (aim for 3-5), provide:\n   - An attribute table (founded, funding, pricing, target market, core value prop)\n   - **Strengths**: 4-5 bullet points on what they do well\n   - **Weaknesses**: 4-5 bullet points on their gaps and limitations\n   - **AI Capabilities**: Specific assessment of their AI features (if applicable)\n\n4. **Feature Comparison Matrix**: A markdown table comparing key features across all competitors. Use checkmarks, Yes/No, or descriptive values. Include 10-12 features that matter most to the target user.\n\n5. **Strategic Positioning Map**: An ASCII-art 2x2 matrix placing competitors along two dimensions most relevant to the market (e.g., PM-Specific vs. Generic on Y-axis, Manual vs. Automated on X-axis). Label each quadrant and mark competitor positions with asterisks.\n\n6. **Competitive Advantages & Vulnerabilities**: Two subsections:\n   - **Our Advantages**: 3-4 numbered items explaining WHERE and WHY we win\n   - **Our Vulnerabilities**: 3-4 numbered items honestly assessing where competitors are stronger\n\n7. **Key Insights & Strategic Recommendations**: 5-6 numbered strategic insights that connect the analysis to actionable product or go-to-market decisions. Each insight should be a bold statement followed by 1-2 sentences of explanation.\n\n## Guidelines:\n- Be honest and balanced. Overstating strengths or underestimating competitors leads to poor strategy.\n- Focus on direct competitors (same problem, same user) and indirect competitors (different solution, same job-to-be-done).\n- Include both established players and emerging threats.\n- Analyze competitor trajectories (where they are heading), not just current state.\n- The feature matrix should highlight genuine differentiators, not just checkboxes.\n- The positioning map should reveal a defensible strategic position or an unoccupied quadrant.\n- Ground recommendations in the analysis, not assumptions.",
