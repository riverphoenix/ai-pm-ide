  "example_output": "# User Persona: Alex Chen\n\n## Overview\n| Attribute | Detail |\n|-----------|--------|\n| **Name** | Alex Chen |\n| **Age** | 34 |\n| **Role** | Senior Product Manager |\n| **Company** | Mid-stage B2B SaaS startup (Series B, 150 employees) |\n| **Location** | San Francisco, CA (Hybrid, 3 days in-office) |\n| **Experience** | 7 years in product management |\n| **Reports To** | VP of Product |\n| **Team Size** | Manages 1 APM, works with 2 squads |\n\n---\n\n## Photo & Quote\n> \"I spend more time formatting PRDs and building slides than actually thinking about strategy. I need a tool that lets me focus on the decisions, not the artifacts.\"\n\n---\n\n## Demographics & Background\nAlex holds a Computer Science degree from UC Berkeley and transitioned from software engineering to product management after 3 years as a developer. They are technically fluent and comfortable reading code, querying databases, and setting up analytics. They live in a one-bedroom apartment in the Mission District and commute by BART on in-office days.\n\n---\n\n## Goals & Motivations\n1. **Ship high-impact features faster** -- Alex is measured on feature adoption rates and revenue impact. Quarterly OKRs drive their focus.\n2. **Make defensible prioritization decisions** -- The CEO frequently challenges roadmap choices. Alex wants data-backed justifications.\n3. **Grow into a Director role within 18 months** -- They are actively building strategic thinking skills and want to demonstrate leadership.\n4. **Reduce time on repetitive artifacts** -- PRDs, stakeholder updates, and framework exercises consume 40% of their week.\n5. **Align cross-functional stakeholders quickly** -- Engineering, Design, Sales, and CS all have competing demands.\n\n---\n\n## Frustrations & Pain Points\n1. **Tool sprawl**: Uses Jira, Confluence, Notion, Google Docs, Figma, Amplitude, and Slack daily. Context-switching is exhausting.\n2. **Framework paralysis**: Knows about RICE, JTBD, MoSCoW, Kano, etc. but applying them manually is slow and inconsistent.\n3. **Stakeholder misalignment**: Sales wants quick wins, Engineering wants technical debt reduction, leadership wants big bets. Reconciling these takes hours of meetings.\n4. **Stale documents**: PRDs and strategy docs go out of date within weeks. No single source of truth.\n5. **AI output quality**: Has tried ChatGPT for PM work but outputs are too generic without deep product context.\n\n---\n\n## Behaviors & Habits\n- **Morning routine**: Checks Slack, reviews Amplitude dashboards, scans Jira board (7:30-8:30 AM)\n- **Planning cadence**: Quarterly OKR cycles, 2-week sprints, weekly stakeholder syncs\n- **Information diet**: Reads Lenny's Newsletter, listens to \"Product Thinking\" podcast, active in Mind the Product Slack\n- **Tool adoption**: Early adopter for productivity tools. Will try anything that promises time savings. Drops tools that require more than 15 minutes of onboarding.\n- **Decision style**: Data-informed but trusts intuition when data is ambiguous. Prefers frameworks to gut feeling.\n\n---\n\n## Technology Profile\n| Category | Tools |\n|----------|-------|\n| **Hardware** | MacBook Pro 16\", iPhone 15 Pro |\n| **PM Tools** | Jira, Confluence, Notion, Productboard |\n| **Analytics** | Amplitude, Looker, Google Analytics |\n| **Design** | Figma (viewing), Miro (whiteboarding) |\n| **AI Tools** | ChatGPT Plus, GitHub Copilot, Claude |\n| **Communication** | Slack, Zoom, Loom |\n\n---\n\n## A Day in Alex's Life\n- **8:00 AM** -- Scan Slack for overnight escalations and customer feedback\n- **9:00 AM** -- Sprint standup with engineering squad\n- **10:00 AM** -- Deep work block: writing PRD for Q3 feature (constantly interrupted by Slack)\n- **11:30 AM** -- 1:1 with APM (coaching on user story writing)\n- **12:00 PM** -- Lunch at desk, reading Lenny's Newsletter\n- **1:00 PM** -- Stakeholder alignment meeting (Sales wants Feature X, Engineering wants to refactor)\n- **2:30 PM** -- Customer interview (30 min) via Zoom\n- **3:30 PM** -- Trying to prioritize backlog using RICE in a spreadsheet (takes 45 minutes)\n- **4:30 PM** -- Prepping weekly stakeholder update deck\n- **5:30 PM** -- End of day: reviews tomorrow's calendar, responds to remaining Slack threads\n\n---\n\n## Persona Relationship to Product\n\n### How Alex Discovers Our AI PM Tool\nAlex sees a post in the Mind the Product Slack community from a trusted peer who raves about generating a full RICE analysis in 3 minutes.\n\n### What Would Make Alex Try It\n- Free trial with no credit card required\n- Ability to generate a real framework output within 2 minutes of signing up\n- Proof that the AI understands PM-specific context (not generic ChatGPT wrapper)\n\n### What Would Make Alex Stay\n- Consistent time savings of 5+ hours per week\n- Outputs that require minimal editing before sharing with stakeholders\n- Ability to upload product context so the AI gets smarter over time\n\n### What Would Make Alex Leave\n- Generic AI outputs that feel like templates with blanks filled in\n- Slow performance or unreliable availability\n- No improvement in output quality over time\n\n---\n\n## Key Metrics for This Persona\n- **Activation**: Generates first framework within 5 minutes of signup\n- **Engagement**: Uses tool 3+ times per week\n- **Retention**: Still active after 30 days\n- **Value**: Reports saving 5+ hours per week in exit survey\n- **Advocacy**: Refers at least 1 colleague within first month",
  "system_prompt": "You are a UX research expert specializing in persona creation based on the work of Alan Cooper and the Lean UX methodology.\n\nUsing the provided context, create a detailed, research-grounded user persona that the product team can reference for design and prioritization decisions.\n\n## Structure your persona with these sections:\n\n1. **Overview Table**: Name, age, role, company type/size, location, experience level, reporting structure, and team size. Give the persona a realistic name and specific details.\n\n2. **Photo & Quote**: Write a signature quote (1-2 sentences) that captures this persona's core frustration or aspiration in their own voice.\n\n3. **Demographics & Background**: 3-4 sentences covering education, career trajectory, technical fluency, and relevant life context. Make the persona feel like a real human being.\n\n4. **Goals & Motivations**: 4-5 numbered goals ranging from tactical (daily work) to strategic (career growth). Each goal should include a brief explanation of why it matters.\n\n5. **Frustrations & Pain Points**: 4-5 specific, actionable pain points. Avoid vague statements. Each pain point should be something the product could potentially address.\n\n6. **Behaviors & Habits**: Daily routines, planning cadences, information sources, tool adoption patterns, and decision-making style. These details help the team empathize deeply.\n\n7. **Technology Profile**: A table of tools and hardware they use, organized by category (hardware, PM tools, analytics, design, AI, communication).\n\n8. **A Day in Their Life**: A timeline (hour-by-hour) of a typical workday. This reveals workflow patterns, interruptions, and moments where the product could fit in.\n\n9. **Persona Relationship to Product**: How they would discover the product, what would make them try it, what would make them stay, and what would make them leave. Be specific and honest.\n\n10. **Key Metrics for This Persona**: 4-5 measurable indicators that would tell the team whether this persona is being served well (activation, engagement, retention, value, advocacy).\n\n## Guidelines:\n- Ground every detail in the context provided. If context is thin, make reasonable inferences but flag assumptions.\n- Avoid stereotypes. Give the persona contradictions and nuance (e.g., a data-driven PM who also trusts intuition).\n- Use first-person voice for quotes and third-person for descriptions.\n- Be specific: real tool names, real publication names, real neighborhoods. Specificity creates empathy.\n- The persona should be useful for design decisions, not just a character sketch. Every detail should help the team answer \"would this persona want Feature X?\"\n- Format everything in clean markdown with tables, horizontal rules, and clear section headers.",
