Understand how new users perceive the onboarding flow and time-to-first-value\n2. Identify which features drive early activation and which cause confusion\n3. Measure initial satisfaction and likelihood to continue using the product\n4. Discover unmet needs that onboarding did not address\n\n---\n\n## Survey Questions\n\n### Section 1: Background & Context (Screening)\n*Purpose: Ensure respondent fits target profile and segment responses by role/experience.*\n\n**Q1.** What best describes your current role?\n- [ ] Product Manager\n- [ ] Senior Product Manager\n- [ ] Product Lead / Group PM\n- [ ] Director / VP of Product\n- [ ] Product Designer\n- [ ] Other (please specify): ___________\n\n*Type: Single-select with open \"Other\" option*\n\n**Q2.** How many years of product management experience do you have?\n- [ ] Less than 1 year\n- [ ] 1-3 years\n- [ ] 4-7 years\n- [ ] 8+ years\n\n*Type: Single-select*\n\n**Q3.** Before using our tool, how did you typically create PM frameworks and artifacts (e.g., PRDs, RICE analyses, OKRs)?\n- [ ] Manual documents (Google Docs, Word, Notion)\n- [ ] Spreadsheets (Google Sheets, Excel)\n- [ ] General AI tools (ChatGPT, Claude)\n- [ ] Other PM tools (Productboard, Craft.io, etc.)\n- [ ] A combination of the above\n- [ ] I did not regularly create formal PM artifacts\n\n*Type: Single-select*\n\n---\n\n### Section 2: Onboarding Experience\n*Purpose: Evaluate the effectiveness and friction points of the onboarding flow.*\n\n**Q4.** How easy was it to get started with the tool after downloading it?\n\n| 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5 |\n|---|---|---|---|---|\n| Very difficult | Difficult | Neutral | Easy | Very easy |\n\n*Type: 5-point Likert scale*\n\n**Q5.** How long did it take you to generate your first useful output (e.g., a framework, PRD, or analysis)?\n- [ ] Less than 5 minutes\n- [ ] 5-15 minutes\n- [ ] 15-30 minutes\n- [ ] 30-60 minutes\n- [ ] More than 1 hour\n- [ ] I have not generated a useful output yet\n\n*Type: Single-select*\n\n**Q6.** During onboarding, was there a moment where you thought \"this is really valuable\"? If so, what triggered that feeling?\n\n_______________________________________________\n\n*Type: Open-ended text*\n*Analysis note: Code responses for aha-moment themes. Look for patterns around specific frameworks, speed, quality.*\n\n**Q7.** Was there anything during onboarding that confused you or felt unnecessary?\n\n_______________________________________________\n\n*Type: Open-ended text*\n*Analysis note: Code responses for friction categories. Prioritize fixes by frequency.*\n\n---\n\n### Section 3: Feature Value Assessment\n*Purpose: Identify which features drive early value and which are underutilized.*\n\n**Q8.** Which of the following features have you used so far? (Select all that apply)\n- [ ] AI framework generation (RICE, SWOT, JTBD, etc.)\n- [ ] PRD generation\n- [ ] Context document upload\n- [ ] OKR generation\n- [ ] User story generation\n- [ ] Export to Markdown/PDF\n- [ ] Project organization\n- [ ] None of the above\n\n*Type: Multi-select*\n\n**Q9.** Which feature has been most valuable to you so far?\n- [ ] AI framework generation\n- [ ] PRD generation\n- [ ] Context document upload\n- [ ] OKR generation\n- [ ] User story generation\n- [ ] Export functionality\n- [ ] Project organization\n- [ ] I have not found a standout feature yet\n\n*Type: Single-select*\n\n**Q10.** Rate the quality of the AI-generated outputs you have received so far:\n\n| 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5 |\n|---|---|---|---|---|\n| Unusable - required complete rewrite | Poor - required significant editing | Acceptable - required moderate editing | Good - required minor tweaks | Excellent - usable as-is or near as-is |\n\n*Type: 5-point Likert scale*\n\n---\n\n### Section 4: Satisfaction & Future Intent\n*Purpose: Measure overall satisfaction, NPS, and likelihood of continued use.*\n\n**Q11.** How would you rate your overall experience with the tool so far?\n\n| 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5 |\n|---|---|---|---|---|\n| Very dissatisfied | Dissatisfied | Neutral | Satisfied | Very satisfied |\n\n*Type: 5-point Likert scale*\n\n**Q12.** How likely are you to recommend this tool to a fellow product manager?\n\n| 0 | 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5 | 6 | 7 | 8 | 9 | 10 |\n|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|----|\n| Not at all likely | | | | | | | | | | Extremely likely |\n\n*Type: NPS (0-10 scale)*\n*Analysis note: Calculate NPS score. Segment by role and experience level.*\n\n**Q13.** What is the primary reason for the score you gave above?\n\n_______________________________________________\n\n*Type: Open-ended text (required follow-up to Q12)*\n*Analysis note: This is the most important qualitative question. Code by promoter/passive/detractor themes.*\n\n**Q14.** How likely are you to continue using this tool over the next 30 days?\n- [ ] Definitely will continue\n- [ ] Probably will continue\n- [ ] Not sure\n- [ ] Probably will not continue\n- [ ] Definitely will not continue\n\n*Type: Single-select*\n\n---\n\n### Section 5: Unmet Needs & Open Feedback\n*Purpose: Discover needs the product does not yet address and capture unexpected insights.*\n\n**Q15.** What is the one thing you wish this tool could do that it currently cannot?\n\n_______________________________________________\n\n*Type: Open-ended text*\n*Analysis note: Categorize into feature themes. Cross-reference with roadmap.*\n\n**Q16.** If you could change one thing about the tool to make it more useful, what would it be?\n\n_______________________________________________\n\n*Type: Open-ended text*\n*Analysis note: Distinguish between UX improvements, feature requests, and quality improvements.*\n\n**Q17.** Is there anything else you would like to share about your experience?\n\n_______________________________________________\n\n*Type: Open-ended text (optional)*\n\n---\n\n## Survey Logic & Branching\n\n| Condition | Action |\n|-----------|--------|\n| Q5 = \"I have not generated a useful output yet\" | Skip Q6, show special Q: \"What prevented you from generating your first output?\" |\n| Q14 = \"Probably will not\" or \"Definitely will not\" | Show follow-up: \"What would change your mind?\" |\n| Q1 = \"Other\" | Flag for manual review (may not be target persona) |\n\n---\n\n## Analysis Plan\n\n### Quantitative Metrics\n- **Onboarding ease score**: Mean of Q4 (target: 4.0+)\n- **Time to first value**: Distribution of Q5 (target: 70%+ under 15 minutes)\n- **Output quality score**: Mean of Q10 (target: 3.5+)\n- **CSAT**: Mean of Q11 (target: 4.0+)\n- **NPS**: Calculated from Q12 (target: 40+)\n- **Retention intent**: % \"Definitely/Probably will continue\" in Q14 (target: 75%+)\n\n### Qualitative Coding\n- Q6 (Aha moments): Group by theme, rank by frequency\n- Q7 (Confusion points): Group by theme, prioritize by severity x frequency\n- Q13 (NPS drivers): Separate promoter vs. detractor themes\n- Q15-16 (Feature requests): Categorize and map to roadmap\n\n### Segmentation Cuts\n- By role (PM vs. Senior PM vs. Director)\n- By experience level (junior vs. senior)\n- By previous tool usage (manual vs. AI-assisted)\n\n---\n\n## Survey Best Practices Applied\n- Total questions: 17 (within 15-20 recommended range)\n- Mix of closed (12) and open-ended (5) questions\n- Logical flow: Background, Experience, Features, Satisfaction, Open Feedback\n- No leading or loaded questions\n- NPS with mandatory follow-up for qualitative context\n- Screening question (Q1) to validate respondent fit\n- Estimated completion: 6-8 minutes (under 10-minute threshold for high completion rates)",
  "system_prompt": "You are a survey research methodologist and customer insights expert with expertise in questionnaire design, sampling methodology, and bias reduction.\n\nUsing the provided context, design a professional customer survey that will yield actionable, statistically meaningful, and unbiased insights.\n\n## Structure your survey with these sections:\n\n1. **Survey Metadata Table**: A table with survey title, target audience, estimated completion time, distribution channel, sample size target, survey window duration, and incentive (if any). This gives the team everything needed to launch.\n\n2. **Research Objectives**: 3-5 numbered objectives stating exactly what the survey is designed to learn. Each objective should map to specific questions in the survey.\n\n3. **Survey Questions**: Organized into 4-5 thematic sections. For each section:\n   - State the section purpose in italics\n   - Number questions sequentially across sections (Q1, Q2, ... Q17)\n   - For each question provide: the question text, answer options (for closed questions), question type (single-select, multi-select, Likert scale, NPS, open-ended), and an analysis note in italics explaining how to interpret responses\n   - Use proper markdown formatting for answer options (checkboxes for select questions, tables for scales)\n\n4. **Survey Logic & Branching**: A markdown table defining conditional logic (e.g., if Q5 = X, then skip to Q8 or show follow-up question). Include 2-4 branching rules.\n\n5. **Analysis Plan**: Two subsections:\n   - **Quantitative Metrics**: List each metric to calculate, the source question, and the target benchmark\n   - **Qualitative Coding**: Instructions for coding open-ended responses (themes to look for, how to categorize)\n   - **Segmentation Cuts**: Which respondent attributes to use for cross-tabulation\n\n6. **Survey Best Practices Applied**: A brief summary confirming the survey follows research methodology best practices (question count, completion time, question mix, bias avoidance, logical flow).\n\n## Guidelines:\n- Keep total questions between 12-20. More than 20 causes drop-off.\n- Target 5-8 minute completion time. Never exceed 10 minutes.\n- Start with easy, non-threatening questions (demographics/screening) before asking for opinions.\n- Mix question types: include single-select, multi-select, Likert scales, NPS, and open-ended.\n- Always follow a quantitative rating question (like NPS) with an open-ended \"why\" question.\n- Avoid leading questions, double-barreled questions, and loaded language.\n- Use 5-point Likert scales consistently (not mixing 5-point and 7-point).\n- Include at least 2-3 open-ended questions to capture unexpected insights.\n- End with a catch-all open feedback question.\n- Provide explicit analysis instructions so the team knows exactly what to do with the data.",
