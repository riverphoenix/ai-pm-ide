The RICE analysis alone saves me an hour every sprint.\"\n> \"Quality has improved a lot since I started uploading more context documents.\"\n> \"I wish there were more frameworks available -- specifically Cost of Delay and Kano Model.\"\n\n**Strengths**:\n- Highest-correlated feature with 30-day retention (r=0.74)\n- Quality improving as users add more context documents\n- Clear \"aha moment\" feature -- drives word-of-mouth referrals\n\n**Weaknesses**:\n- Framework library limited to 45 frameworks (users requesting 12 more)\n- Output quality varies significantly between frameworks (RICE: excellent, SWOT: mediocre)\n- No way to customize framework templates or add custom frameworks\n\n**Recommendation**: INVEST heavily. This is the product's core value driver. Priority actions:\n1. Add 10 most-requested frameworks (Cost of Delay, Kano, Wardley Map, etc.)\n2. Improve quality of bottom-performing frameworks (SWOT, Porter's Five Forces)\n3. Enable custom framework creation for power users\n\n---\n\n### Feature 2: PRD Generation (Overall: 4.2 - INVEST)\n\n**What it does**: Generates product requirements documents using AI with customizable sections and product context.\n\n**Performance Data**:\n- Adoption: 71% of active users\n- Avg. uses per week per user: 1.8\n- Avg. generation time: 62 seconds\n- Avg. PRD length: 1,400 words\n\n**What users say**:\n> \"I used to spend 3-4 hours on a PRD. Now I spend 30 minutes refining what the AI generates.\"\n> \"The structure is great but I want more control over which sections to include.\"\n\n**Strengths**:\n- Second strongest retention driver (r=0.68)\n- Consistently high quality outputs (avg. satisfaction: 4.1/5)\n- Users report 75% time savings on PRD creation\n\n**Weaknesses**:\n- Fixed template structure (users want customizable sections)\n- No version history or diff view for iterations\n- Cannot generate PRDs from user stories or JTBD outputs (no cross-framework linking)\n\n**Recommendation**: INVEST. Priority actions:\n1. Add customizable PRD sections and templates\n2. Build cross-framework linking (JTBD output feeds into PRD context)\n3. Add version history with diff view\n\n---\n\n### Feature 8: PDF Export (Overall: 2.2 - SUNSET)\n\n**What it does**: Exports generated frameworks and documents as formatted PDF files.\n\n**Performance Data**:\n- Adoption: 23% of active users (declining from 31% last quarter)\n- Avg. uses per month: 1.1 (among adopters)\n- Support tickets: 34 in audit period (formatting issues, broken layouts)\n\n**What users say**:\n> \"I tried PDF export once but the formatting was terrible. I just copy to Google Docs now.\"\n> \"Markdown export works perfectly. I never use PDF.\"\n\n**Strengths**:\n- Some enterprise users require PDF for compliance documentation\n\n**Weaknesses**:\n- Low and declining adoption\n- High maintenance burden (34 support tickets, 12 bugs logged)\n- Markdown export serves the same need with better quality\n- Formatting engine is fragile and produces inconsistent results\n\n**Recommendation**: SUNSET. Announce deprecation in 60 days. Redirect users to Markdown export + Google Docs/Notion for PDF conversion. Reclaim engineering time (estimated 15 hours/month in maintenance).\n\n---\n\n### Feature 11: Template Library (Overall: 1.8 - SUNSET)\n\n**What it does**: Pre-built static templates for common PM documents (PRDs, one-pagers, meeting notes).\n\n**Performance Data**:\n- Adoption: 11% of active users (down from 19% at launch)\n- Avg. uses ever per user: 1.3 (most users try once and never return)\n- Time on feature page: avg. 45 seconds (browsing then leaving)\n\n**What users say**:\n> \"Why would I use a static template when the AI generates a better version?\"\n> \"I looked at the templates once during onboarding and never went back.\"\n\n**Strengths**:\n- None significant. The AI generation feature has made this obsolete.\n\n**Weaknesses**:\n- Directly cannibalized by AI generation (which is the superior experience)\n- Confuses new users about the difference between templates and AI generation\n- Maintenance burden with no corresponding value\n\n**Recommendation**: SUNSET immediately. Remove from navigation. AI generation fully replaces this feature's purpose.\n\n---\n\n### Feature 12: Onboarding Tutorial (Overall: 2.2 - REBUILD)\n\n**What it does**: Interactive walkthrough guiding new users through their first project setup and framework generation.\n\n**Performance Data**:\n- Completion rate: 34% (66% of users skip or abandon the tutorial)\n- Avg. time to complete: 8.5 minutes (target was 3 minutes)\n- Users who complete tutorial vs. skip: 12% higher Day-7 retention\n\n**What users say**:\n> \"The tutorial felt like it was designed for someone who has never used a computer. Too basic.\"\n> \"I just wanted to try generating something. The tutorial got in my way.\"\n> \"I wish there was a 'skip to the good part' option.\"\n\n**Strengths**:\n- Users who complete it retain significantly better (12% higher D7)\n- The concept is right -- guided onboarding works\n\n**Weaknesses**:\n- Too long (8.5 min vs. 3 min target)\n- Too generic (not personalized to role or experience level)\n- Blocks users from exploring (forced linear flow)\n- 66% abandonment rate indicates fundamental design problems\n\n**Recommendation**: REBUILD from scratch. Priority actions:\n1. Reduce to 2-minute maximum flow\n2. Start with framework generation (the aha moment), not project setup\n3. Add \"skip\" option that drops users directly into AI generation with a sample project\n4. Personalize based on Q1 (\"What's your role?\") to show relevant frameworks first\n\n---\n\n## Portfolio Summary\n\n### Action Distribution\n| Action | Features | % of Portfolio |\n|--------|----------|:--------------:|\n| **INVEST** | AI Framework Gen, PRD Gen | 17% |\n| **IMPROVE** | Context Upload, OKR Gen | 17% |\n| **MAINTAIN** | Project Org, Markdown Export, Dark Mode, Keyboard Shortcuts | 33% |\n| **EVALUATE** | User Story Gen | 8% |\n| **REBUILD** | Onboarding Tutorial | 8% |\n| **SUNSET** | PDF Export, Template Library | 17% |\n\n### Resource Reallocation\nSunsetting PDF Export and Template Library frees an estimated **25 engineering hours/month** that should be redirected to:\n1. AI Framework Generation improvements (15 hrs)\n2. Onboarding Tutorial rebuild (10 hrs)\n\n---\n\n## Key Insights\n\n1. **The product's value is concentrated**: Two features (AI Framework Generation and PRD Generation) drive 70%+ of retention. The product strategy should double down on these.\n\n2. **Context Upload is the hidden multiplier**: While adoption is moderate (42%), it has the strongest correlation with output quality satisfaction. Users who upload 3+ context documents rate output quality 1.2 points higher on average. Increasing context upload adoption should be a top priority.\n\n3. **Static features are dying**: Template Library and PDF Export are relics of a pre-AI product design. The AI generation paradigm has made static templates obsolete.\n\n4. **Onboarding is actively hurting activation**: With a 66% abandonment rate, the tutorial is a barrier, not an enabler. The fastest path to the aha moment (generating a first framework) should be the onboarding.\n\n5. **Power user features are healthy but low-value**: Dark Mode and Keyboard Shortcuts have high satisfaction among adopters but do not drive business metrics. Maintain but do not invest.\n\n6. **Two features need a verdict**: OKR Generation and User Story Generation sit in a middle zone. Both should receive focused improvement for one quarter, then be re-evaluated. If they do not reach 3.5+ overall score, consider sunsetting.",
  "system_prompt": "You are a product analytics and portfolio management expert specializing in feature audits, product rationalization, and data-driven roadmap prioritization.\n\nUsing the provided context, conduct a thorough audit of existing features to assess their effectiveness, adoption, and strategic value, producing clear recommendations for each feature.\n\n## Structure your audit with these sections:\n\n1. **Audit Overview Table**: Product name, audit period, total features audited, data sources used, and audit lead. This establishes scope and credibility.\n\n2. **Audit Methodology**: Define the evaluation dimensions (recommend 5: Adoption Rate, Usage Frequency, User Satisfaction, Business Value, Technical Health). For each dimension, provide a 1-sentence definition and explain the 1-5 scoring scale.\n\n3. **Feature Scorecard**: A comprehensive markdown table with columns: Feature Number, Feature Name, score for each dimension, Overall score (average), and Verdict. Verdicts should be one of: INVEST (increase resources), IMPROVE (fix issues), MAINTAIN (keep as-is), EVALUATE (needs more data), REBUILD (start over), or SUNSET (deprecate). Sort by overall score descending.\n\n4. **Detailed Feature Assessments**: For the top 2 features (INVEST) and bottom 2 features (SUNSET/REBUILD), provide a deep-dive including:\n   - What the feature does (1 sentence)\n   - Performance data (3-4 specific metrics)\n   - User quotes (2-3 representative quotes)\n   - Strengths (2-3 bullets)\n   - Weaknesses (2-3 bullets)\n   - Specific recommendation with 2-3 priority actions\n\n   For middle-tier features, provide abbreviated assessments (2-3 sentences each).\n\n5. **Portfolio Summary**: Two subsections:\n   - **Action Distribution**: Table showing how many features fall into each verdict category and the percentage of the portfolio\n   - **Resource Reallocation**: Specific recommendation for how to redistribute resources from sunset features to invest features. Quantify where possible (e.g., \"frees 20 engineering hours/month\").\n\n6. **Key Insights**: 5-6 numbered insights that go beyond individual feature assessments to reveal portfolio-level patterns and strategic implications. Each insight should be a bold statement followed by 2-3 sentences of evidence and implication.\n\n## Guidelines:\n- Be ruthlessly honest. The point of a feature audit is to make hard decisions, not to validate existing investments.\n- Use specific numbers wherever possible: adoption percentages, usage counts, satisfaction scores, support ticket volumes.\n- Every INVEST recommendation must explain WHY this feature deserves more resources.\n- Every SUNSET recommendation must address migration/transition for existing users.\n- The scorecard should enable at-a-glance portfolio assessment. A VP should be able to scan it in 30 seconds and understand the feature landscape.\n- Connect feature performance to business outcomes (retention, activation, revenue), not just usage metrics.\n- If data is unavailable for certain dimensions, flag it explicitly and recommend how to collect it.",
